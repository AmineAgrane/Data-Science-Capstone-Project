Note: Apparently this was a sequel to another TV-movie made earlier the same year (titled Killer Hair), and both were based on the “Crimes of Fashion” book series by Ellen Byerrum. Feh.

Corruption and cronyism are endemic in Greece. But no politician or senior businessman had been convicted in recent years, fuelling popular frustration with mainstream parties that pledge to uphold the debt-laden country’s international bailout and remain in the euro zone.

Here are the fabulous Design Team creations for this week! Hope they inspire you to have a play yourselves. Do pay them all a visit and let them know what you think!
As performance art goes, I say well done! However, as far as efficiency, customer service and general awareness of how germs are spread goes, I say holy crap this is UNBELIEVABLE!
The licensor, except as noted below, usually bears responsibility for the cost of filing, prosecuting and maintaining licensed patents. This includes future patent applications if improvements are included in the agreement.
Apparently you have to go there.
Have a fabulous week fellow artists. I hope to be here more often now that I`m feeling creative again.
Now, while the meat was tender and salted nicely, like the lamb, it too was extremely rare. I’m not one to shy away from rare meat, but again the bloody juices combined with those of the lamb and the cacciatore sauce resulted in one hot mess. The fingerling potatoes, all nine of them, halved and roasted with rosemary were, in the words of Simon Cowell, "totally forgettable" and at $14, they shouldn't have been.

Blog founder curator Taylor Jones stumbled onto the idea while browsing through an old family album. He found a picture of his younger brother, and saw that his brother was also in the room, giving him a weird sense of nostalgia. Jones got his camera, took the old photo, lined it up with the original location, snapped the picture, uploaded it, and within a few months his blog had gone viral.
Let's not forget, I'm one of the lucky ones, fortunate to land an academic job despite the imbalance of supply and demand caused by the huge number of PhDs conferred yearly. Others will have very different career paths, and will land jobs in other fields, for which they don't have explicit training.

Three hours later, I still sat there. The once-warm sun was setting now. It was almost 4:30pm, and I wasn’t sure what to do. Dave had said to stay and wait for him. I was worried. It shouldn’t, couldn’t have taken that long to get to the 7-Eleven and back, could it? I finished off the last of the Cheetos, and went back to the swings. An hour later, I knew something was wrong. It was starting to get dark, and some of the street lights were already starting to come on. There was nobody else in the park anymore. They’d all gone home to dinner or wherever else it was people went after a day in the park.
*That probably would have been a safer choice, hehe.
With that being said, recently, for the first time in my life… I lost my grip. I forgot how to smile. I have no energy to muster a smile. Not to say that I haven’t always been moody and temperamental, but this time it’s been definitely and completely different. I have succumbed to unexplained extreme depression and anxiety. I have no idea how this happened, nor do I have an explanation. I have a chemical imbalance. I feel like I’m having a heart attack on a daily basis. (God-forbid) For as long as I can remember, my personality has always been the cheerful, lovey-dovey, outgoing…you know, the “no backbone” type. I’ve rarely uttered the word “no” to anyone outside of my immediate household and this at times, has made a mad-woman. Yes, I know all to well that you can relate… we all find ourselves in this situation at one time or another. To say the least, just maybe my mind has just decided to finally throw my hands in the air and give up? I really don’t know how this happened. (I keep looking for a legitimate reason, yet I now know the triggers) Something that I can confidently say is that this change of life is and has been for way too long, kicking my ass. I am 41 years young and absolutely menopausal. (TMI, I know, but I really don’t care anymore) It has hormonally, been an emotional roller coaster and I am trying desperately to repair a broken spirit. Again, anyone that knows me won’t be surprised when I say that my creativity has spiraled downward. This is nothing new… it’s been spoken of countless times among friends and loved ones in the last couple of years. When I lost that creative feeling, I guess I lost a pretty good sized chunk of my soul. I have been lost without it. Like an itch that you just can’t scratch. Patiently waiting for my muse to return… spending many hours in my art studio just looking around for something to do- to no avail. I am and have always been very (duh!) high energy and have become very high maintenance. Sitting idle and stagnant has NEVER agreed with me. Maybe this has something to do with my mental collapse? Who knows? For some reason, in writing, it seems as though the loss of creativity adds an enormous key element to all of this. Trust me, it does take its toll but I am also not naïve. Blame cannot entirely be cast upon my loss of creativity; it’s just an easy scapegoat. There are of course, a number of other circumstances that have added to my stress level over the last few years. Those, I’m just not willing to chatter out loud to the world about.
Britain’s Consumer Price Index (CPI), a major gauge for inflation, will reach 2.8 percent this year and drop to 2.1 percent next year.
Next is this little vintage box of title letters for the old movie cameras. I remember Dad had a Super 8 movie camera when I was growing up. I wrote and directed my first film using that camera. My siblings and I then went onto the big chunky VHS camera and made many short films and documentaries. A full length feature my brother, sister and I wrote, directed and starred in was called 'Nightmare on New Street' (we lived on New St). A thriller, come mild horror that starred a meat cleaver hanging from a broom stick with fishing wire. We used a hair dryer to flick pages of books to make it look like a ghost was reading it - it was a classic! At one stage we needed a voice over for one of my little sister's scenes, we were in a bind as she had gone to bed. As my brothers voice hadn't broken yet we used his scream, worked perfectly. I hope we can find the movie one day and it's still watchable, it was a bit of a crack up and even had a gag real to the song Dizzy byVic Reeves with the Wonder Stuff. Ahh, thems were the days.
I would like to thank BLESSMA for the help and support my family received when my wife’s mother died recently. Bill, Kath and her husband have been there for everyone. A few years ago when my Father-in-law died they were a great support and two weeks ago when my Mother-in-law passed the knowledge that they were there helped my wife and daughter cope.

I haven’t been drinking heavily as a form of painkiller as I thought I might under the circumstances; though I have had some beers for sure. I’ve had occasion to stop off at mom’s place a time or two in the last few weeks and I always take a moment to have a cold beer out on her patio – just one, maybe two – never too much to count me out for the hour long drive back to my place. (I had coffee and donuts one morning, too by the way.) It’s good therapy, there in the shade, with the incessant heat licking at the edges of the patio cover and at the edges of my soul; watching the wildlife.
Ladies Class III (Emily)
The sky was overcast with clouds that threatened rain. The air was somewhat cooler than it had been in the past week so it seemed like a good time to do the work that needed doing. Although I had pulled weeds and transplanted flowers last week, there still remained empty patches rapidly refilling with weeds and large clumps of marigolds to be thinned. Pansies and snapdragons that had spontaneously sprouted around the garden had to be corralled into their respective areas, and the snails had to be dealt with. All this I did, and as I uprooted, transplanted, weeded and watered, I couldn't help noticing the smile on my face and how good and energetic I felt in spite of the fact that I hadn't slept nearly enough. At last I stepped back to survey what I had done and I stood in awe. The weedy, open areas of dirt, the dense clumps of marigolds and haphazard patches of pansies were gone. In their places stood orderly rows of flowers and soil free of weeds. It was as if in the process of putting the garden to rights, it had undergone a metamorphosis. It looked better, to be sure, but it was more than that. It FELT better. It felt RIGHT. It was as if everything was finally where it was supposed to be and this created an energetic shift. I looked at my garden as if I was seeing it for the very first time, not unlike the way a father looks at his daughter when she is ready to leave for her prom, with pride, awe and wonder at the beauty of it all. It was a case of the whole being more than just the sum of its parts.

Further books on Russia followed in the wake of his reception into the Church, along with a number of genre-defying humorous volumes, Diminutive Dramas, Dead Letters, and Lost Diaries, in which subtle pastiche, mischievous satire, and sheer farce are combined in equal measure. It was, however, as a novelist that he would finally receive the literary recognition commensurate with his superlative gifts.
But it had been sitting too long.
Apparently the untimely death of Mark Hellinger meant that the original script was revised and certain aspects of the story were changed. Be that as it may, the movie that we ended up with is almost impossible to fault and Daniel Fuchs’ script successfully blends the heist and Steve’s obsessive love to powerful effect. Flashback structures can sometimes be confusing or upset the mood of a film but in this case it works perfectly, coming at precisely the right point and filling in the background details that are vital to understanding the nature of Steve and Anna’s relationship. With a tight script, and Franz Planer’s photographic talents, in place, director Robert Siodmak was free to put it all together with his customary visual flair. The opening, which I referred to earlier, pitches the viewer headlong into this complex tale of dishonour and betrayal in incredibly stylish fashion. And it never really lets up from that moment, with one memorable and superbly shot scene following hard on the heels of another. Siodmak uses every trick up his sleeve to manipulate the mood and perspective, from coldly objective overheads to disconcerting low angles and close-ups, interspersed with fast cuts and dissolves. For me, the real stand out scenes, although there’s hardly a poor moment throughout, are the ones in Union Station and in the hospital. The former not only gives a fascinating glimpse of contemporary LA bustle, but also shows the director’s skill in composing a complex series of shots in a crowded environment while retaining control of the geography. In the latter, he uses the reflection from the mirror in Steve’s room to break up the static nature of the setup and extract the maximum amount of tension at the same time.
How do you know you’re praying to “the God revealed in Scripture”? - Study the Word. Don’t accept the image of God portrayed by the world, even though it appeals to the natural mind. A kind, gentle Santa Claus figure, dispensing good times with no sense of justice or truth, appeals to guilty sinners. Look to the thunderings and lightnings of Mount Sinai. Gaze at Jesus on the cross of Calvary –hanging in unspeakable agony because of the justice of a holy God. Such thoughts tend to banish idolatry!
Consider violence. We are terribly concerned when someone slaps or punches someone else. A fight can get you into prison. And that is remarkable, because our prisons themselves, and the police who fill them, have been inordinately tolerant of their own violence over the years, and we have been pushing our fellow citizens toward police and prisons at an extraordinarily high rate (Weiss, 2010). This is not what one might expect from a population committed to nonviolence. Wealth does not seem to be getting us away from violence.
Romy is doing okay now. She still seems to get uncomfortable. She is HAPPY to report that her feeding tube is out...not before she pulled it out, and I had to put it back in of course...but it is gone for good, and she LOVES her food.

Also as a historian the Bible is a good book on history in those times just like the iliad and the oddysey are good looks into Greek culture and lifestyle. These books are used in science because even though they still have religous content they are filled with what those people believed in, how they lived, what they did. It gives clues that people than use too further look for things so as for the bible being useless that is incorrect.

Our home has a slab foundation, which means we sit on a block of concrete (and according to Mr. Sugarplum, also an ant hill). So there are no outlets or vents in the floor, only the walls and ceilings. The furniture in this room floats in the middle, away from the walls and subsequent outlets. And to make things even more difficult, there is only one accessible outlet.
It may indeed be a Lonely Place To Die, but when loneliness looks so bloody gorgeous, company is overrated.
The other benefit of the KDP Select program is that Prime Members can check it out for free. I can't imagine anyone would use their check-out on a 99 cent short story, so I doubt I will see any income generated from that. The drawback as I've stated in the past, is that in order to use the KDP Select Program I have to list the book exclusively on Amazon for 90 days. Fret not, Amazon does have free applications that can be downloaded so anyone can read this book on other devices. I think being it's a short story it's more likely that will happen than if it was a full length novel.

Some sort of parroty bird with subdued, hushed colors, a parrot, long tailed, flaps a burst of speed and tucks wings in again and roll and curves in front of the van, under the power lines, over a bit of wire fencing, into the bush. Another follows. Riding the wind gusts, gusts you could see on the grass, can see, wow, really see, pushing the tops of the trees around. Must be a male, thinks E@L of the bird, but then why in pairs, why one chasing the other? Love or is it jealousy? Such subtle hues for a parrot, rosella, parakeet, whatever you call them (E@L is not an ornithologist either) they're usually brightly feathered. Not this lot. Must be British. None of that color stuff! Maybe they were pigeons.

The ravens at the Tower are huge. There is the belief that if the ravens ever leave the tower then the monarchy will collapse. It appears that feeding them fresh meat, including the odd rabbit, isn't enough to ensure they stay. They also clip their wings so that they cant fly away. I also read that raven's mate for life. I always get a little kick out of animals that seem to fall in love and hang together forever.

Nigel Hall - Keyboards/Vocals
Over the years, I have taught in discrimination training that we deal with each other at four levels: fear, tolerance, acceptance, and unconditional love. Each of these emotional states is impacted by the factors set forth above. What other fears might we have about each other? Most fear is born out of ignorance. How can we educate ourselves to ameliorate those fears? How can we facilitate an engaging dialogue about new and old at our organizations? How do we understand that all of us have more in common than we do that is different? For example, many senior leaders have fears/concerns about the work ethic of the Millennials. Is that justified? Are there any facts to support it? Likewise many Millennials and GenXers value life/balance as much if not more than career success. Are they right to be concerned about/fear senior employees that exhibit what they perceive to be work/life imbalance? Tolerance is the second level where we deal with one another. In a sense, we’ll do you no harm because you’re different from us. This is essentially what the law mandates. In these rapidly changing times, age and experience seem to have less significance in the marketplace, generating age discrimination claims. Fact is, a company shall do no harm because of one’s age but does not have to tolerate a lack of performance or lack of engagement into an emerging culture. Senior employees can’t be viewed as pulling up the rear. They have to set the example of constant improvement- a willingness to be open to new ideas.
Iron Man showed the world that superhero movies can be fun, witty, action packed, engaging, adventurous, well-written, expertly directed, fantastically acted, and most of all, pretty darn good. Superhero movies don’t have to be half-baked, poorly written, 2-hour cheese fests. Long gone are the days of “let’s cast somebody big! like, uh… Ben Affleck!” (facepalm.) Iron Man has it all, especially in the acting department. Robert Downey Jr owns Tony Stark and has great chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow’s Pepper Potts.

I see the advertisement on DAFT.ie is 22 days old. NAMA has said that as part of its approach to agreeing business plans with developers, the developers will be required to bring unencumbered assets to the table. It is not known if the sale of “Winterwood” is at the behest of NAMA.
You can smell the coffee immediately upon pouring the beer and it is almost overpowering, in fact the smell is more powerful than the taste of the beer, which itself is coffee with a subtle dark bitter chocolate kick to it. I don't drink much coffee if I'm honest, because I dislike instant crap and only drink expresso when in a coffee place. This delivers on the coffee front nicely although as I mentioned it is a strongly scented beer.
He knew that his body was a temple of the Holy Spirit and he had to have it in good condition to withstand all the punishment and work that he would encounter along the way. If you are a believer, you also are to take care of that body of yours as God’s temple so that He can use you as He did the apostle Paul.
My husband and I went to the NICU to give Peyton some presents in the morning and he was completely fine. That evening we went back to give him his last few gifts, and were just in time to see the nurses begin blood cultures on my tiny bundle. They said something was wrong, but they weren’t sure what. Within 10 minutes he was pricked at least 7 times trying to get blood out of his tiny veins with no success. It was shortly after that they informed us that they though he might have an infection in his intestines and would be transported to Children’s Hospital in Pittsburgh for further testing. After a 90 minute drive and 4 hours in the waiting room, we were finally able to see Peyton. They told us that he was very sick with Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC), and may require surgery. A couple days later that option was a reality and my less than 3 pound and 3 week old baby was going under the knife.

Don’t cross your arms. Even if you only know one or two ways to read body language, you probably know this one — crossing your arms is a sign of defensiveness and passive aggressiveness. That’s not the impression you want to convey, so put your hands on the table where they can’t cause you any trouble.

I bold words and ideas I consider important, and doing so can drastically change the meaning of words and sentences. This is a trick I learned from reading comic books. Observe the following. What is the difference when I say, “You don’t have to” from, “You don’t have to”? The former statement can be taken as is, but the latter raises further questions. Have? Or need? Or want? That emphasis also adds some color to the sentence.

During the time of Jesus’ birth an evil King named Harod ruled the earth. When King Herod heard of the news, he became very upset of the birth of a baby boy that was to replace him as the King to the Jews. And so in his anger, Harod called together all the chief priests and teachers of the law to find out exactly where the Christ was to born. In the city of Bethlehem, in Judea the baby boy king was born in a mangers stall. For on that night, a new star appeared shinning brighter than bright. The kings Magi said to the King, this was the sign of the light.

Margarine isn’t a bad example for building a case against nutritionism; it’s probably the best one there is. While I think that Pollan somewhat overstates the role of nutritionism in pushing margarine into the mainstream (mainly by understating the importance of wartime butter shortages and lower prices to margarine’s success), it has become sufficiently clear that the nutritional establishment erred in recommending that Americans consume trans fats.

The making of an icon, Chrysography, means “writing in gold,” and these works, meant as mediators between humans and God, imprint the guilded light of piety and age on your heart. Lovingly crafted and full of the force of tradition and meditation, icons remain the ultimate dream of art. Although that dream is impossible to find these days, great power comes from staring into the eyes of those that dreamt it.

This feeling started almost immediately after Deacon's surgery. I guess it technically started in the hospital - on day 2. When I felt like Deacon was replaced with a "new" baby (http://sweetleighmama.blogspot.com/2011/12/surgery-craniosynostosis-repair-day-2.html). And it lasted until about a month ago - the end of January. But the strange thing is - I never realized it was postpartum depression until recently. While I was in the throes of it, it never once dawned on me that what I was feeling was depression. It was only once I began to spiral out of it that I realized what had been going on. I knew I wasn't myself. I knew something was wrong. But I couldn't put my finger on what it was. All I could tell people was that, "I just don't feel right."

HomeRoutines is the app to get control of those recurring tasks, and keep them from cluttering up your email, your calendar, or your big to-do list.
One important thing that all network internet marketers have to do would be to understand the product or service in order that you are able to get other folks excited regarding it. You need to understand every thing you should know and stay willing to share this so the item will offer effortlessly, and it will be possible to respond to any queries that come up.
Been busy doing some DT work today so no new card to share. However, I would like to share something with you. I really like all the little crochet flowers that are appearing on some cards at the moment. Well, I can crochet but haven't done for many years. So this morning I went to my local craft shop and bought some crochet hooks, wool and some patterns.
A little while later our landlords showed up with their handyman to make some repairs while they were here anyways. I was housebound while I waited for the handyman to finish up, so I decided to finish the new pillow covers for the living room couch. It was nice to finally get this project done!
There are SO many types of bees, this just shows a few. Many people are allergic, if you don’t know if you are or not please be tested, it’s Very scary if your highly allergic and it could take your life. I was allergic when I was a child but not severely, I did not have to carry a bee kit. However I grew out of it & I am not now. That doesn’t mean I don’t stay away from them because I do, it still hurts when they sting you. These pests are EVERYWHERE in the spring & summer. Especially near blooming flowers, I have several fruit trees and lots of flowers and a huge garden that all need pollinated to produce fruit, flowers or vegetables so bees are here & I have to be mindful when outdoors exercising. Find more information about bee stings here. Here’s a picture I took in the yard of a swarm of hornets a few years ago. So glad I didn’t step right on this while I was walking – that might have ended in hospitalization, Hornets pack a powerful punch when they sting.

Mr. vG came home in the middle of my project and was quite impressed with my layout of knobs. But of course, had something to say. He thought that the primer was a good step to ensure a better adhersion of the paint, however, if you want to take it one step further, he suggests sanding lightly with a ultra high grade sanding paper, one that won't leave scratch marks and then priming and painting. Urgh. Well, I quit at my six knobs then...only 32 more to go tomorrow when I pick up some sand paper. So many knobs...
The weekend was a blur of brunch and dinner, high heels and hair spray, and speeches and tears. The facility they chose was non-traditional, but probably the most beautiful wedding location I’ve ever been to. It was an empty warehouse style room, with exposed brick walls, floor to ceiling windows, and etherial white drapes separating the ceremony space from the reception space. The color scheme was purple, grey, white, and black, and everything looked just perfect.

The extent of the loss of the tradition of Infant Communion among the Eastern Catholic Churches was noted by Fr. Casimir Kucharek’s Ukrainian Catholic catechism Our Faith: A Byzantine Catechism for Adults. Writing in 1983, he explained:

On the tax cuts versus spending question we find that every ethnic minority group is less supportive of greater government spending than the white British group. In this respect they appear to be less ‘left-wing’ than the majority, which contrasts strangely with their greater support for Labour but may suggest that those who do not have an affiliation to Labour are more inclined to vote Tory than Lib Dem given our position going in to the General Election. In further items covering different aspects of the left/right dimension there was either no significant difference between the majority and the minority, or the majority was more left-wing than the minority.

My recurring dream is back. It's been a while since I last dreamed it and I would've been quite happy if it never revisited me. It's about as disturbing as any dream I can remember. I used to have a couple pet Cockatiels years ago and one of them was especially sweet and dear to me. In the dream I go down into a part of our basement that's secluded from the rest of our house, a place where I seldom go. When I open the door I find the bird cage with both Coocoo and Coconut inside. I'm shocked because I've totally forgotten that they were there and it's been months since I've fed them or given them fresh water. They're so neglected although they don't appear to be but I feel terrible and I'm profoundly sad. It ends about as quickly as it begins. It usually occurs to me the next morning that I had the dream again and it leaves me both disturbed and with a sense of relief that it was only a dream.
I have always wanted to commit myself to a martial art discipline. There were just too many excuses and obstacles that prevented me not to. After trying Aikido way back in college, I decided not to pursue any art that would take years to master and would require youth and great flexibility.
What makes the book so entrancing is Rob Ryan and his paper artwork of paper cut-outs that are so detailed, so intrinsically complete (a night scene depicting the girl looking out of her window is done in midnight blue and has stars and smoke from chimneys cut out, with the smoke cutting into the church steeple and trees!), it really has to be seen to be believed. The illustrations “framing” the text of the story adds a very dreamlike quality to the book. It is one of my firm favourites as it ticks all my boxes, and I only hope that one day it will tick all of Sophie’s (my daughter) boxes too.
That's all I really need.

However this may be an opportunity to really discuss what people who are or would be members of a social community for teachers, service providers and even some parents/caregivers of individuals with multiple, severe or low incidence disabilities would want in a social community. Most of us who used the Ning used it to ask and answer questions and to share ideas (i.e. how do you manage having too few paras? what does your schedule look like? have you tried XYZ curriculum program?). This could certainly be done on a listserv that comes into our e-mail box, perhaps with more participation. For people who uses the Ning solely for that it sometimes becomes just another site to check on (I am the founder and often feel that way. I have also often wished that Ning forwarded full e-mails to me and allowed me to reply from my e-mail instead of forcing me over to the Ning site to respond.).

The Rocco revival style of art emerged in the 18th century as artists put aside their desires for equally balanced decorations and, instead, focused on more fluid and colorful patterns of decoration. The artisans employed by Carl Schumann porcelain focused on creating lines of dinnerware with lots of brightly colored fruit, flowers and nuts These decorations were offset by the milky white, almost translucence of the high quality porcelain that the factory used.
I am sick-and-tired of people who talk in whispered tones about this “Kaffir Mentality” that is wrecking our lives. And when I say “people” I’m also referring to other ethnic groups, including several blacks who don’t think twice about using the word “Kaffir”. I know it’s an ugly word, but is it not time we start calling a spade a spade? Why should we speak of a “South African Mentality” when these issues crop up. It is not a South African mentality, it is a Kaffir mentality – full stop!

It’s too easy to let morality and common humanity fall by the wayside as you pursue your ambitions. The Templars are heroic because they fight to defend humanity when at times they may feel humanity is no better than the creatures they face. That’s especially true in Dark Goddess when Billi realises the enemy is just as dedicated as her, and they may be right, not her.

Taking this even further, a story can have pictures and music too, becoming an “app” rather than an e-book. Eventually, taken far enough down this route, it will become a game and no longer be a book.
The other piece of that is that you will say, “I need help right now.” And it is not that we do not hear you, or that that request, that heartfelt request, is not received. But also sometimes, in your plan and in the larger unfoldment, there is divine timing.

It has been SUCH a long process, this planning stage. Mostly that's my fault, because I've made a gazillion changes since the first draft. I have a super-patient contractor, though, who has yet to fire me.

Donald’s willingness to experiment led him to designing and maintaining our web site, way before the National Church considered one, which opened up the Manuscript and Photographic Collections to the wider world as never before. The highly successful Mission Archives section on the site evolved as a result of the demand for these records by academic researchers. With only a paper listing of the collection and no real means of cross referencing, Donald set about rearranging and describing the collection to enable it to be entered into the electronic catalogue ‘Ark’. Along with the completion of the preservation of the Mission photos Donald’s knowledge of the ins and outs of mission activity in the Church enabled him to become ‘the authority’ for those inquiring about Presbyterian mission activity.

Finally, here is the finished Lilac branch. Notice that I added BG000 to my sky. This helps give my blossoms a sense of place. If you leave it white the blossoms have no foundation or reference points- they're just sitting there. By adding a subtle blue sky we assume that the blossoms are outside, the sun is shining, and it's a lovely spring day. Blue is also a natural background color that feels far away. By keeping the blue pale and subtle it doesn't detract from the whole (also, by adding a background color it helps cover up any mistakes you couldn't erase completely).
I mention all this because I kinda have a daydream… a fantasy, if you will, of the day I tell you about this blog.

Building A Winning Business by Tom Salonek is useful for its pragmatic approach ($9.95, softcover, http://www.intertech.com/) as it focuses on 70 “takeaways” that will improve anyone’s management skills. Based on his own experience and his father’s advice on how to work with people, the author shares how he grew his own company from $2 million in annual revenue to more than $10 million, despite the burst of the technology bubble and the worst recession of our time. He offers succinct, good advice on the fundamentals of hiring and managing employees, identifying top talent, and weeding out those with poor performance. I have seen a lot of books filled with management advice, often twice or three times as thick as this one, but this book delivers the goods. Joe Banda asks whether you are a leader and then answers with his book, You are a Leader ($14.95, Langdon Street Press, softcover). A slim volume, the book uses historical and political examples of why anyone can become an effective leader by tapping qualities they have, believing in themselves, and taking charge. It is a conventional book of unconventional wisdom that explores ten intangible qualities that exist in everyone.
The looming August 2nd deadline for raising the debt-ceiling, and the stalemate in Congress make this plan a possible option for the Obama administration. It is a maneuver where the President can bypass the will of Congress and skip over the debt limit by having the Treasury mint a trillion dollar platinum coin. The idea, in one sense, is reminiscent of other Presidential end-runs like a recess appointment or a pocket veto. In this case you could call it finding monumental pocket change in the seat cushions at the Treasury.
A stromboli is more or less a big stuffed sandwich, similar to a calzone. With some styles of stromboli, the ingredients are layered over the dough and then rolled for a spiral effect. With some, like this one, the ingredients are piled on and the dough is wrapped around them. This stromboli starts with an easy homemade bread dough and just gets better from there with fresh ingredients like spinach, mushrooms, garlic, red bell pepper and lots of ooey gooey mozzarella cheese.

So, colour me impressed. I am surprised Jason Kenney and the Conservatives did something like this. They have, after all, inherited a mess of an immigration system that has wound itself into a Gordian Knot and someone has to wield that sword sooner or later. While I applaud this move it still does not address the main problems of too many immigrants coming to Canada and too many coming from too few source countries. If reforms are to be made it is not only in cutting the numbers we accept each year in total but also the mix as well.
The doctor said not to get discouraged. He diagnosed Evan with what he calls "Second Child Syndrome." Arabella, being older, is doing all of the talking for him. He gets by with his signs when he wants something, which cuts down on frustration for everyone, but when we ask verbal questions that may or may not apply to both kids, Arabella always has the answer. Therefore Bubba doesn't feel the need to vocalize his opinion because she's already done it for him. I guess part of me realized what she has been doing, but I just let it slide.

Politically, Morrison says he's always voted Republican (in the election of 1913, he says he "wanted" T.R. to win but voted for Taft because he believed Taft would win, but then realized "it was Wilson all the time"). He claims he would have voted for FDR in 1936 "if I hadn't been sick this year," even though he thought Hoover would take it. He thought Nixon would win instead of JFK in the 60's but lost because of Japanese voters ("The Japanese they run out of California during the war"), which outrages him because his grandson (also named George Morrison) died while dive-bombing and sinking a Jap battleship in WWII; he was his daughter's only son.

I chose Giant Flowers along with Art Philosophy. Are you tired of my flower projects yet? My goal is to make all the flowers in the cart. So far I've made the lotus, daisy, ashley, and poppy. So I have three more: peony, rose, and the hibiscus. Today I'm showing the peony. Originally the peony was suppose to be part of the fall wild flower bouquet that I showed for the blog hop over the weekend. But the peony does not have a bottom, its made in a ring with no backing. You can see in the sneak peak, the purple showing at the bottom is the background paper, you can also see the leaf stems peaking through too. I was not sure how I would make a bouquet of peonies, attaching the stem would be tricky. So I ended up making a home decor project, wall art. Again its Fall theme using the same paper as the Wild Flower Bouquet, CTMH Dreamin'.

Yet this morning, I was jolted back so forcefully that I could not only hear my father’s voice but see every detail of how he looked—old blue singlet, checked shirt and all. Now to Dad, these words seemed to mean he needed to keep working hard rather than that there would be no heavenly rest or peace for the wicked. At that time, Dad claimed he rejected the idea of eternal life in any form and used to say with finality, ‘When you’re dead, you’re dead.’

Jeepers. Like Snickers could get any worse for you--now it's got caffeine in it? And what the hell is taurine? Further investigation (thank you, Wikipedia!) reveals that taurine is an "organic acid", and a "major constituent of bile". Yum! I can only assume the good folks at Snickers have included it in their limited-time-only version of a Power Bar because it's been shown in diabetic lab rats to decrease weight and sugar levels. Awesome! B-vitamins, though, that's something that's actually good for you, though, right? Except, since there are like, 22 different b-vitamins, it's kind of hard to know exactly which ones the Snickers people mean. So who knows what you're getting, there.

ECO STATIONS: There are three Eco Stations in Edmonton: one in Ambleside, one in Coronation, and one in Strathcona. These buildings are a place where one can bring in household hazardous waste (which includes paint, motor oil, batteries, herbicide, lightbulbs, cleaners, etc), electrical appliances (toasters, old computer monitors, power tools, etc), old sofas and other furniture, and just normal recyclables (paper, cans, old clothes, etc)! You can also take home some free paint and bags of compost mixture. If you have old, broken props, leftover building supplies, or even a drill that won’t work anymore, take it to an Eco Station!

However, comparing the price I paid for rentals versus the price of new showshoes on the internet, if my kids used them TWICE it would have been more cost effective to have just bought them. Plus, the rentals at the Nordic center don't come with poles. They don't have any collapsible or kid-sized poles. Most of the snowshoes for sale online come with poles. Given the snow that dumped around our house this week and the 3 snow days the boys had off of school, I'm sure they would have used them just to walk around outside the house this week.

Although I struggled with the Spanish phrases (needing to consult an online translator to aid my basic, patchy Spanish), its use was very effective and adds flavour to the characters and to the overall plot. I found that and the touch of Mexican culture unique and very enlightening. Not to mention the sense of brotherhood, loyalty, danger, and most of all the sense of self present in Perfect Chemistry very gripping.

Pop your dough onto the counter top, cover with the up turned mixing bowl and leave for at least 15 minutes or until you are ready to cook and eat the bread.
Anyway, all went well, checked for leeches a few times (hundred?) and none (phew...). No other wriggly things were lurking around and I actually finished the whole garden - mulched. I was absolutely drenched with sweat and hurting in places I didn't know I had muscles - shoveling, wheelbarrowing and spreading wet mulch is heavy work. After stopping for a rest, I decided to do a bit of weeding in the vegie garden and happily spent the rest of the afternoon potting around. Away from the mulch and the rocks, I had completely forgotton about checking for leeches...

And then they all got drunk and fucked their mistresses. I bet Strategic Air Command circa the Kennedy administration made Madmen look like a Middle School dance.
Furthermore, as Craig goes on to make clear, even if the intention is simultaneous with the event that it causes, this does not mean that it is not *causally* or *explanatorily* prior to the event: the man’s intention to hold onto the tree-branch is what explains his holding onto the tree branch, not the other way around. I see this as a “the dog wags the tail, the tail doesn’t wag the dog”-kind of point.

I sadly don’t have any pictures of us competing, but imagine us on the show jumping track, wearing pink. She was legendary. I even snuck in a bit of pink (against the rules) when we did dressage shows. No one ever called us on it.
Tuesday, 22 October 1872,
The kids, drinking their green smoothies while Dad reads the Bible verse for today and shows off the felt palm branches. (ps, are you as distracted as I am by the crazy mop on my kid's head? it refuses to be styled.)
Place in a large saucepan stalk side down, with several cm of water, (add a little salt and sugar) and boil for 25 - 45 minutes depending on the size. (Mine were done in 30min)
I was blocked the other day. Not terribly. Got a blog out and 8 pages, but I was running into a little plotting trouble. The I remembered my own rule. Constant Contained Conflict.

The phone rings and we see that Roy is asleep in bed alone. Simms is calling to tell him he has a visitor. Roy asks who it is and Simms says "a very attractive young lady, who says she's your mother." Roy tells Simms to send her up. She knocks and he says "Come on in Lilly." Lilly says "Long time no see." and kisses him on the lips. Roy answers "Eight years." before offering her some instant coffee. They sit down for coffee. Lilly tells him she's still working for a bookie. Roy remarks "an easy life." She answers "Usually." Lilly says suspiciously, "I'm not sure what you're up to."

For I already had a career. I taught, and still teach, social studies at a junior high school, and during the summers, my husband and I have been building a modest cabin in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. A full life. A happy life. A life with some bloody down time!
With the move to provide more educational content on the Web, a Student Web Accessibility Project was developed specifically to support accessibility of instructional resources on campus. The project had several components, including assessments of online instructional resources against Section 508 standards for Web accessibility, development of resources to support the creation of accessible online course materials, and assistance to developers in integrating accessibility into project planning and design of instructional sites. Findings were published in EDUCAUSE Quarterly in 2007.
I’ve always loved music – unbeknown to me at the time – I liked a few DnB tracks too! The Shy FX tune ‘Shake Your Body’ came out when I was 12 in 2001 and I loved it, I remember loving it every time the video came on MTV and dancing in my living room to it. I didn’t know what Drum and Bass was at the time but I know I liked it! When I was younger I used to write songs and sing, I remember trying to produce electronic music to go with the lyrics on my keyboard or on crappy software but I’d get frustrated because it was very limited what I had to work with. I used to love going raving and to the parties back home and would always want to be the one performing.

Possibly my favorite dish of the evening was the pork belly sliders. The buns were slathered with a heavy hand of butter so the charred butter was a bit overwhelming. But it otherwise went really nicely with the sweetish pork inside.

All three of those references describe a very human Jesus. And, so far as the Christian canon is concerned, they – together with what I described last week – were the entirety of the known life of Christ until the Gospel of Mark was written about 15-20 years later.

As I have pointed out many times, there is only one elected official in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government. That official – the President – then appoints each cabinet member and other bureaucracies that in turn appoint (hire) a full staff for themselves. Elect one person, and you are stuck with millions of appointed people.

Where am I leading with all of this? Barefoot running can be a means to an end to improve your running form. It can also make you more aware of your body in relation to its surroundings. But, in the long run (pun intended), you will probably still need to have your feet shod, at some time or in some capacity. This is especially true for snowy/icy weather conditions, and rocks and "sharps" protection on the trails and roads. And, if you want to go faster in a race, you should probably be shod. Find out what's right for you, whether it's a pair of super-light 3.8 oz Universe, or a pair tire tread huaraches. And if you're not having issues while still wearing your "normal" running shoes, then don't fix what ain't broke.
And in the meantime, it looks like I’ll have to develop a similar relationship with Pinterest. The question is — will pinterest become my ‘pictures from high school’ depository or will it be something more?

The credibility and moral authority of those at the helm of the NO side, especially the Christian clerics hinges on the outcome of the August 4th plebiscite. Unless they defy the pollsters and conventional wisdom and come out on top the leaders of the Catholic Church and several Protestant groupings risk unleashing a backlash of leadership credibility if their folk ignore their sermons and admonitions and vote for the Proposed Constitution.
AU: The cover focuses on the romantic aspect of the book, but also does implicate quite strongly that there is a Greek mythological twist to this story. The lightning also goes really well with the book, which becomes apparent when you read it.
Professor Bebbington is lead researcher on the new research which is published today (Friday, 1 July) in the July issue of the British Journal of Psychiatry. The research uses data from the 2007 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. The researchers found that non-consensual sexual intercourse before the age of 16 was strongly associated with psychosis. They also found weaker associations with being sexually molested and inappropriate sexual talk.
I’m sure you’ve heard of making cakes in a mug. I’ve tried this a few times, and have been somewhat unimpressed with the results. For some reason, I tried it again tonight. The results were decent, definitely needed more sugar, but I think that’s because I used dark chocolate cocoa rather than the regular. I used a recipe from Chocolate Covered Katie’s blog and she calls it One-Minute Chocolate Cake.
This isn't so much about the Broncos, which is good since they are playing poorly, but more about the Steelers. Pittsburgh is on the road in the thin air of Denver. They will be without three important starters including their fantastic C Maurkice Pouncey. QB Big Ben is banged up, not moving well, and the Steelers' running game has struggled all season--making them a throwing team. All this could help the Broncos defense generate several much-needed turnovers. Turnovers that have been missing during their losing streak.
This is a verse that keeps popping up in my head… And makes me wonder.
You’re a dance in Bali.
People believe that I think I am better than everyone else and therefore judge others my age for partying and doing things because well, I'm better than them because I don't. Peer pressure? It's there. I overcome it by simply standing my ground. I refuse to budge when it comes to anything else I'd do; I'm a very stubborn person, therefore I find it incredibly easy to dust off peer pressure.
8/4 Indianapolis, IN- Indiana State Fair
It was a rather grey day with the first heavy snowfall of the season forecast for later on. I arrived at the hospital by bus and planned to return home using the same method of transport. At no point did I fret over the operation. In fact, I still recalled my GP's words when she first saw me last summer and the phrase "laser the sty off" kept coming back. So, I carried on thinking that the procedure would be quick and painless. A radio with the station Magic FM was on with Queen's We are the champions playing to the whole ward. The signs couldn't have been more encouraging.
The “Other” side as some of you have pre-ceived it to be and some even call it the “dark” side or oppositional side may it be. See these “movements” in a challenge, strife, war move…etc…. by this you are playing into THEIR HANDS, ringing the bell of truth to their feelings or views. They then feel they need MORE control of you and your movements! You see Chelas, you are playing as I say into the hands of the “Dragon” Which I compare to “FIRE” energy.
The night I was born, a doctor who was caring for me told my father, “Your daughter is a fighter.” Still today, I draw strength from those words. My mantra has become “P.A.S.T. – Preemies Are So Tough.” Whenever I feel down or discouraged, I remind myself of my past. Compared to being kept alive by a respirator and feeding tubes, nothing seems insurmountable.
I used the Prayer of St. Francis, which we all are familiar with if for no other reason than having heard the song that was made using the words of this prayer. I have been singing that song ever since I created this card! LOL! Anyway... my card base is Bazzill and is cut with Spellbinders Labels 23 Grand. The prayer is stamped on My Mind's Eye Bella Bella dp. I used Cheery Lynn Exotic Butterflies Small, Versafine Sepia Ink, Martha Stewart bough punch,ZVA Creative small white roses, and the larger pink rose if from the bridal dept. at Micheal's. This was super quick and easy but with the cut shape, it packs quite a punch!
Lazy-boy sofas and loveseats are very heavy, so we removed all the backs to make them lighter. I was amazed how those two strong burly men picked it right up and carried it out through the deck doors with no problem at all! Oh, to be young and strong!
All of that is a long lead in to say that we had roommates from all over the country with little exposure to Southern delicacies. Being proper Southerners, we found it our duty to educate them. Part of their education was boiled peanuts. My parents happened to visit me one weekend as a stop on a road trip, and they brought with them a bushel bag full of green peanuts (basically immature peanuts that have not yet hardened). As we started cooking, a roommate from New Hampshire walked in and asked, “What are those? Peas?” Now you can’t blame him for being a Yankee, but…Anyway, after a few hours we served up the treat. Most of the house gave rave reviews, but there were a few skeptics that we couldn’t convert. Oh well, I don’t ask that you love them, but I do ask that you give them a try.
Surely there must have been a better way to go about it. I didn't qualify for any scholarships, work studies or grants -- but maybe I didn't try hard enough to find ones I *did* qualify for. My monthly student loan payments are on par with a 160K mortgage and I won't even own a home at the end of them. I do wonder whether I would have finished my degree when I did, if at all if I had had to go half-time and worked harder to earn money to pay for college. I only finished my degree because I was able to live with family rent-free after transferring to another school. If I had just done that in the first place would I be in the financial hard spot I'm in now? Probably not. No one really cares where you get your bachelors degree anyhow, only that you have one.
In the past four months I’ve gone to various art galleries. I’ve seen Mesoamerican antiquities, aristocratic clothing through the ages, local artists, classic art work.

Dayna Martin's session on "Unschooling the Spirited Child" was absolutely fantastic. The marquee was packed, and it seemed that everyone there was parenting at least one of these wonderful children! I loved Dayna's positive spin on it, the idea that these children are a gift to the world, and to our families, and we can learn so much from them. Through the unschooling lifestyle, we are able to give them the gift of being able to be Who they truly are. We must shift from control to connection. These kids DEMAND to be free; to not be controlled. They can help us to learn and grow as parents, by helping us to see things in ourselves that need to change, as we learn to respond to them with love and grace. We need to stop seeing them as broken & needing to be fixed. They are whole children.

Again it would perhaps be easy to forget that the rest of the world was continuing to turn and many events were to occupy the minds of Bishops at the Lambeth conferences of 1908 and 1920 before the new prayerbook was to come before parliament in 1927 for approval. Arrangements for relationship with other provinces, the facility of divorce, the use of contraception, the role of women in the church reflecting the rise of suffrage, racism, business ethics, of marriage and sexual immorality, the reunion of Christendom, the rise of organised labour and
Monday evening I realized something that I had sorta taken for granted or maybe not....Before I started with WW's On-line I was looking for something to help me with my cravings and had heard lots of things about PGX so I picked up a bottle to try....so I started and of course like other attempts at weight loss that didn't last long and the bottle sat on my counter for a couple of months. I guess I was in the process of getting both my mind and body ready for change.
The car issue was not so easily remedied. After ruling out that the battery was in good working order, talented Daddy continued his diagnosis. Starter. No big deal. Okay, it was a big deal.

I was excited at the idea, but baffled as to how someone in Virginia could tap into the movie- and TV-making machine, much less learn how to write screenplays. However, as I asked around and did some digging, I found out that there was a Virginia Film Office right here in Richmond who’s job it was to support local film industry professionals and encourage studios to come film their projects in the state.
“Maybe it’s because he’s black.” But Carol frowned and took a closer look. The pup seemed to struggle more than its siblings in the crawl for its mother’s belly, and its hips seemed narrow, making it look more like a teardrop than the oval shape of the other two. The puppy began to suckle with enthusiasm. “I’m sure he’s fine. Look at him eat!”

That part of the world is unified in some ways, and it’s concretely different from what’s farther west. It’s really the first west. It features a kind of rawness that you don’t find when you get farther west when it gets emptier. When I’ve written about that, I’ve tried to dig into that in-between-ness.

For me to come to the point where both of my kids are in school (one is still a baby stage) everyday and I have free time in the morning is momentous. I should be celebrating. However, I am feeling sentimental instead.
Fast forward a few years and with the Storm on the verge of new era of dominance the rival coaches, through their friends in the media, launched a series of attacks on the fact that the Storm were becoming too dominant in the ruck through the use of wrestling tactics. The fact that these were within the rules and nobody else was doing it half as well had nothing to do with their angst. Not. So the ‘Grapple Tackle’ controversy was born and while the league and its judiciary did nothing to stop the trend, the attacks on the team continued.

I made the curls by taking jewelry wire and wrapping it around a pencil. Then I used my Versamark pen to get them good and wet. I dipped them in the Blueberry and then heated them up. I actually did this twice just to make sure I got it nice and thick so it would really show up.
Like most modern fiction deemed “serious” ever since the 1950s, it deals with resigned acceptance of alienation. That is why I stopped reading serious fiction in favor of genre, like mysteries, science fiction and fantasy. I hate reading about resigned acceptance of alienation. To me alienation should be approached with a sense of the absurdity of the mental derangement that so often prompts it or with pure fury at the injustice that may have engendered it.

I toyed with the idea of taking one home to nurse back to health, but since Tucker was rabidly running through the yard searching for more bunnies, I decided that would most likely mean certain bunny heaven for that unfortunate one. We were all slightly disturbed from this nature channel moment, and none of the smaller kids found out about it. It was quite the feat to keep them inside during the rescue; we didn't want to scare them or open the floodgates of "why?" questions.

During my teens, and into my early twenties, I would spend up to eight hours a day here; this is where all the local booters session.

Tactics: Only attempt to ram opponents from behind, so they don’t know that you’re coming, or on maps that don’t have armor lock as an option (which will destroy a ghost rather easily). The plasma bolts are strong and can get a lot of exposed enemies. As a driver, you’re constantly exposes from the sides so if you’re low on health feel free to burst out of harm’s way to replenish shields. As a bonus, ramming elites is even easier. Never get too close to the enemy or stuck in a corner- ghosts are very easy to hijack. As ghosts get damaged, their ‘wings’ get clipped making ramming a fair bit harder.

Their hair was once shoulder-length and what’s left of it now is mostly grey. Two of them are still following the same path they started down in the late Seventies, in a country of soaring unemployment and inflation, where contraception was illegal and divorce was banned. Others of them are now household names, as writers, journalists and commentators. Back then, they were young, unknown and there was no obvious outlet for their talents. So they set about doing it for themselves: in 1977, Niall Stokes and Mairin Sheehy founded Hot Press.

But while the overall numbers of moviegoers are slightly female heavy, the ticket sales are exactly even.

This time Capcom’s Street Fighters take on Namco Bandai’s Tekken characters in an over-the-top 2 vs 2 tag fighter.

Liv is hilarious though. She says the funniest things. Sunday I went into our little bathroom in our room to change and throw on some make-up and she followed me in there, shut the door and said "mama, what da matter?". I looked at her and laughed then said "nothings the matter Liv" and she continued on with "tell me what da matter?". Haha, there was absolutely nothing wrong, but it was so cute and thoughtful that she felt the need to come ask. I don't get to see that side of her every day.

5. If you have the problem of not being able to “visualize”, then use a pen and paper, and write it down, or a recorder and speak it out loud. Looking at a picture, like the rose in this article, and imagining touching it, smelling it, and looking at it in “real life”, also helps. So, get a picture of what you want to manifest and use it in your daydream.

The inhabitants of the city rebelled against this plan and have finally won this battle. A 12-kilometer park was built through the heart of the city.

He then follows this, almost perfunctorily, with a letter that explains the film's whole plot, because after a climax like that, there's not much to do but quickly wrap things up and call it a day. As Sir John reads this letter, the shadows of the circus crowd flit by on the wall behind him, giving the scene a weird, disconnected feeling, as though the hero has quietly tucked himself off in a corner, isolated from the chaos, to resolve the plot. It's fitting, too, that the film then ends with a curtain coming down on a theater's stage, a last playful touch that accentuates the artificiality of these dramatics.

Always Right won five of his six starts in point-to-points for his owner/trainer John Wade and made a winning debut under Rules as he powered to a 12-length success in a novices’ hunters’ chase at Perth in May, 2008. He failed to build on that effort in two appearances during the 2008/2009 campaign, falling in an Ayr hunters’ chase before trailing home 11th behind Cappa Bleu in the Christie’s Foxhunter Chase at the 2009 Cheltenham Festival. Always Right returned to action 12 months later, easily winning a Kelso hunters’ chase in March, 2010. He raced again at the Scottish track when second in a handicap chase in October of the same year and capturing a similar contest in February, 2011. Always Right provided Wade with the biggest success of his career to date at Doncaster the following month when he gamely repelled the challenge of Lothian Falcon for a head verdict in the Grimthorpe Chase. He also ran a superb race to take third, beaten a length in total, in the Grade Three Scottish Grand National at Ayr in April, 2011. Always Right continued his upward curve at the start of the current season as he stayed on to beat Skippers Brig in a Kelso handicap chase on December 4. He was stepped back up in class for the Grade Three Rowland Meyrick Handicap Chase at Wetherby on December 26, but failed to travel with any fluency and was pulled up with three fences left. Further disappointment followed in the Grade Three Betfred Grand National Trial at Haydock on February 18 when Always Right faded quickly and was pulled up approaching the second last fence. He was given a soft palate operation shortly after that race and connections are hopeful that he can return to form in the John Smith’s Grand National.

OK, so now let's get down to the nuts and bolts of putting this cover together. I needed several things: A font, an image, and a tool to design the cover in.

During our four year going to the same place, we never tried their drinks!!! We always stuck with water as cheap asians since the fondue was already damn overpriced! But they changed their menus this year to have a cheaper fondue price if we ordered tea as well. So here is my Japanese Green Tea Matcha Latte/Tea. I was really excited since I've recently discovered my love for anything green tea. (Green tea ice cream, matcha etc..) I can't believe I was missing out for the longest time during my high school years!! My fellow classmates were obsessed with it and always bought Green Tea ice cream during our breaks. I did try it a few years back, but it was too 'odd' for me.. Things do change.
What makes this report unique and essential to read?
The first day of the wedding will mostly just be family members and the women will get henna done. The second day will be in my village and the third day in Khemisset. I hear weddings can last into the wee hours of the morning and is filled with food, music and dancing. I am excited to experience my first Moroccan wedding so closely as a family member! After the third day of the wedding, Fatima-Zahra will then permanently live with Rashid and his family in their 3-story home. I will miss her but luckily she is very close and it will be easy to visit. She wants to have a baby right away and hopes to have lots of children since she said she was often lonely growing up as an only child.
Then finally a slice about our typical day
Of course it takes me a while to work through these thoughts in my head. Yes, I am overweight. Around 2 stone to be even within a healthy range.
We’ll see from this point on where fate sweeps young Ao and Naru. There’s Gazelle and Co., there’s the JSDF and OSDF, and there’s Generation Bleu, who are rather surprised to see the Mark I flynig around, considering they believed it was scrapped years ago. There’s lots of danger and peril in these first episodes, but also lots of heart and determination, and lots of colorful, likable characters. We were better able to sort everything and everyone out this week, and this looks to be a most immersive sci-fi-drama. Not as in-your-face or insane as Aquarion Evol, but more serious and mature.

Angelo Marc Jandugan need not be too worried as the Singapore government has proclaimed its intention to mass-import more ‘foreign talent’ like himself into Singapore as exemplified by a statement released by the National Talent and Population Division under the Prime Minister’s Office two days ago:

I'd been using the bag daily for the dog walks since I received it and really enjoyed having the ability to carry the keys, cell phone, spare mag and the Springfield Champion with ease. The weight is distributed so well that you hardly feel it. The mesh backing ensures it is nearly sweatproof from standard athletic activities.

So excited to have a space that is all mine and that will allow me to be more creative!

Sassoon married his first wife, Elaine Wood, in 1956, but the marriage ended in 1958 when she left Sassoon for British water-skiing champion David Nations. In 1967, Vidal Sassoon married his second wife, actress Beverly Adams. They had four children: two daughters, Catya (1968–2002), an actress who died from a drug-induced heart attack, Eden (born 1973), and two sons, Elan (born 1970) and David. Sassoon and Adams divorced in 1980. His third wife was Jeanette Hartford-Davis, a dressage champion and former fashion model; they married in 1983 and divorced soon after. In 1992 he married Ronnie.

In view of the lack of written description in the specification for fully-human, A2 specific, neutralizing, high affinity antibodies, Centocor’s argument that an inventor need not physically make an invention to claim it misses the mark. Indeed, we have repeatedly indicated that the written description requirement does not demand either examples or an actual reduction to practice. . . . What it does demand is that one of skill in the art can “visualize or recognize” the claimed antibodies based on the specification’s disclosure. In other words, the specification must demonstrate constructive possession, and the ’775 patent’s specification fails to do so. Centocor’s asserted claims to fully-human antibodies “merely recite a description of the problem to be solved while claiming all solutions to it.” The actual inventive work of producing a human variable region was left for subsequent inventors to complete.
Gangs, drugs and pimps have brought a cloud of fear and discouragement to this community on South Robinson, and The Salvation Army is reaching out to the citizens of that area, as well as those being prostituted, to offer hope, support, friendship and aid.

This feeling is having a bit of a funny effect. I think I’ve mentioned before that I haven’t really suffered any of the pregnancy symptoms making the first trimester so miserable for so many. I’ve felt very tired a lot, at times exhausted; but so far there’s hardly been any nausea at all, and not a single incidence of puking. My boobs have gotten a big fuller, but they haven’t yet gotten much bigger – and there’s also been hardly any soreness. Only during the night, when I get up to pee. I do have to pee a lot – I consider a night when I’ve only had to get up once an undisturbed night. My appetite’s been less than it used to be (though I think it’s coming back) and there’s some foods I feel like eating less than I used to, but there are no real food aversions – I can eat anything. I feel stuffed easily and am really bloated, but I’m not suffering constipation. I could go on like this.

“After killing off a few skeevers and one more crazed bum, I made it to the Ragged Flagon. The place was kind of a dump, but I had to hand it to Brynjolf…the place had style (in the rough rogue-ish sort of way). I approached Brynjolf, who was in the process of defending me to his fellow thieves. He gave me a task to prove my loyalty to the guild. The guild was running an extortion racket with the local merchants, and several had gotten a little too bold recently. They were refusing to give the guild their cut.

So, I went to the Egyptian Tea Room, and hookah parlor, to play their open mic with the two brothers. It was an interesting place and a tough crowd to play, but not a bad deal, all in all. It is a cramped space to play, but I don't think the sound was half bad and we did a far better set than I expected. It was the best I've heard them play, and the best I've done with them.
If creating art is not your thing then try making photo collages using Shape Collage, Microsoft AutoCollage or Andrea Mosaic. Microsoft AutoCollage definitely has a big ‘wow factor’ but Shape Collage does offer more control over their finished collage as it allowed them to choose a background colour, border colour, shape and overlap. Andrea Mosaic is a different sort of thing entirely and some might think it needs too much effort as you need a large selection of images to get a good result. The resulting creations have a big impact though.
A series of leaks on the progress of the war, and then a report on what appear to be plans for an expedited US withdrawal, have had the media abuzz with stories and analysis, but with no real consensus – a question of heat but very little light.

The “New Hope for Multiple Sclerosis 2011 Canada Tour” is its latest venture in the hopes of making testing, treatment and follow-up care widely available in Canada. This Tour is being sponsored by Canadian businesses and individuals who have joined their voices and resources to make a difference and give “New Hope” to the MS community in Canada.
I love this book because it's a children's book that doesn't read like one. Yes, Carroll wrote it for a 7 year old girl (who starts as the main character), but Alice goes through some seriously traumatic experiences that take on a whole new perspective when an adult reads it. Some of the characters and places she encounters are outright nightmarish (and no, contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence to suggest that Carroll was a drug addict). Alice is also constantly pressured to identify herself, but she can't. She thinks she knows who she is, but quickly learns that she doesn't, and it's absolutely frustrating and terrifying to navigate an unfamiliar world. Eventually she is forced to figure it out and find her way... aren't we all?
The Boddington's records are the dullest I've seen. Page after page of Bitter with an occasional Mild. Just two beers. How excited they must have been in the brewhouse when the Oldham Brewery closed and they got two new beers to brew. The Oldham Mild looks a nice beer. Maybe we should do that next. It'll fit right in with Mild Month, if we're quick.

This way, termed ‘non-violent communication,’ means that no one gets offended and your relationship remains the same. It’s all about the self-control. We all need to let off some steam now again, but you can control the aftermath.
So, essentially he is creating a legend by repeating some nine documented historical errors as the truth.
This is the first time the charity has released its internal data on its youth programs. Officials said the report is meant to show the need for continued public support for children’s programs. The Alexandria, Va.-based Salvation Army ranks as the nation’s second-largest charity by contributions after the United Way.

The higher being did create this day as a day of rest and I will honor it in that way by leaving a lot of things undone. I will pretend that I can't do a thing about them right now and enjoy the peace and serenity the day can bring. That means I will contemplate my navel and think only wise things. It will be a major time out.
What if we are unwilling or unable to love others or open up to the power of love to heal? When we use man as the standard by which we understand and apply love, then we will continue to be unwilling and unable. On the other hand, if we seek to please God and use His standard, then our unwillingness and inability will soon gravitate toward willingness and able to do so; how can it not?
And, when my first marriage was failing, and I felt I would surely lose my mind if I didn't find a job...

This little beauty is one I’ve made a few times in the limited time I’ve had the recipe. It was gyled with the pale ale but at only 1.0025 points difference they are nearly identical and you aren’t gaining anything gyling these babies up. As for the AK’s, I just love the AK’s and really do wonder why they died out like they did. The combination of grainy husky American 6-row malt with the elegant English pale malts (MO, Optic, etc) really make this beer layered. The maize is usually never enough to be ‘corny’ but you definitely get a ‘maizy’.
ANDREW: Did not.

MARS #: 176.1 (Series)
I could stay here for at least another year doing work for other sections that at best maintain my career and at worst knock me off track by learning too much about an area of law I actively dislike. I can't get into too many specifics, but basically, my section is changing. People have left- for personal reasons, and the occasional firm-related reason- it's added up to a lot of people. Right now I'm the second most senior associate in my section. I've lost my mentors. We've gone from being a major player within the firm to feeling like more of a satellite team, lending support of cases centrally staffed outside our city. None of that is necessary bad, but I feel like my learning has slowed and my favorite parts of my job- interacting face-to-face with a group of super smart people, working on big cases involving big money and complicated legal issues- those opportunities are dwindling as the cases move outside my office. I gained some amazing experience working on a huge IP matter this year, but that was outside my section and outside the area of law I actually want to practice and, looking forward and seeing more IP opportunities than corporate litigation opportunities on the horizon, I felt I needed to make a choice: either jump in to IP with both feet and move downstairs and join that section, or leave this office or the firm generally to pursue corporate and securities litigation. I could coast along for another year, collecting paychecks and helping out with small roles on other matters, but I wouldn't be growing and that's what being an associate is supposed to be about. I don't want to interview somewhere as a potential 5th or 6th year and have gained no substantive experience since my 3rd year.
Anyhoo, Paul and I scurried around all day getting the place just so. You know Paul, a place for everything and everything in its place!! We set out place cards and had just lit the candles when the doorbell rang! I gave Paul a quick peck and said “It’s show time!” I opened the door, and of course, there were Rick and Karen Santorum right on time.

The act also established a decimal system of currency for the country and set the various denominations of the coins.

This was not a good week. I had no motivation what so ever to exercise. I took a quick walk 1 day and that was my only exercise all week. I also started celebrating my birthday a few days early so when I weighed in Friday I was up 1 lb. I gotta kick it into high gear this coming week!!
Haley was released today! This morning, things weren't looking promising, but by noon her oxygen levels stabilized and they sent her home. Haley is still healing up, but our happy, energetic girl is back, and boy was she missed. We have to continue to give her some medicines and do breathing treatments with a mask for the next three days, but at least she's home and away from all the machines and doctors.
Another time, I persuaded a twelve-year old boy from school to run away with me, and we sneaked off during lunch and stumbled through the woods to the highway. I will always remember the briars and vines and tree roots, and how weary my feet and legs felt. It became very cold as the evening progressed and the two of us were freezing. When we reached the highway, we stuck out our thumbs to hitchhike out of the area with no destination in mind. We made it as far as Atlanta, Georgia when an old redneck farmer with a Southern accent stopped in his old pickup truck. We climbed in the front seat of his truck and had only traveled a few miles when he suddenly turned off the highway, drove us down a long road into the dark woods, and raped me with his headlights shining through the sinister trees. That poor boy and I both expected to die. But the man drove us back to the interstate and left us there. I never was so happy to see the lights of a police car as I was that night, when the cops pulled over to pick us up and drove us to a runaway shelter. I did not tell anyone about the rape, so the man never was sought.

They have the most luxurious kitchen products imaginable. Most have price tags that will curl your hair. Some though are downright reasonable, like this very stylish jar opener. I cannot stand the contortions I have to go through sometimes to open jars; running it under hot water, turning it upside down and banging on it, wedging it in the doorframe... only to finally concede defeat and ask my husband to open it for me. So much better to have this handy tool in the drawer.

In the program’s final piece, Johan Inger’s “Falter,” a jungle of hanging ropes compressed the stage’s vertical space, trapping dancers in a live horror story. Dancers used free floating strobe lights to highlight different parts of the stage, to give their own movements inhuman ticks and to scan one another’s bodies. Throughout the first section, unlit dancers slinked across the bottom of the stage like spiders while soloists demonstrated technical virtuosity with complicated jumps and turns.

The MACC should therefore be proactive in carrying out independent investigations into corruption in the system and develop indicators to identify corruption in migration practices and policies, instead of merely waiting for individual case reports to be filed before they react. Tenaganita also proposed that the MACC look critically at the links between corruption and human trafficking.

Following my MRI and visit with the orthopedic surgeon, the final diagnosis is better than I had feared. It is not a ligament rupture; it is a plain stress fracture of the Navicular and possibly also the cuboid, two of the chunky bones on the top of your foot at the ankle. It appears the main culprit was running down hills, something I will have to be very careful with in the future. I was surprised that I had cracked the chunky bone rather than the long thin metatarsals, but there are big ligaments that attach to the chunky ones and pull hard enough to fracture them when pulled over and over and over and over.

Leo says he watched the figure for about 3 minutes, took all his photos, and then observed the figure go into a thicket of trees, only to never appear again. The group watched for 10-15 minutes but no sign of the person ever appeared. The tourists all laughed and joked about it having to be some idiot professional climber with a dress fetish, but Leo knew what had seen. He had finally seen Mildred Packer himself, though he said nothing to the tourists around him. Leo says that he went and added his own encounter to his Mildred Packer logbook.
He accused Cao of a “blatant push shot”, which, replays have shown to be inconclusive. He then went on to say “It seems to be a bit of a trait for the Chinese players because there’ve been instances in the past, of fouls and blatant cheating going on. It needs to be corrected.”

Well, I just can't beleive how much time has flown by these last few months! I've been working on my own now since August and I really enjoy my job. I love the unit, and especially the crew I work with. They are supportive, funny, hard working, and have your back in a pinch. I am still learning and that's probably why I love it so much, you're always learning and every shift is a new adventure! It's hard to put my experieances down on paper because there has been so many and I don't even know where I would begin.

I binged today. 3 donuts. 1 escargot pastry. 2 english muffins, 2 pre-packaged desserts that didn’t even taste any good. I have every intention to finish writing & vomit so I can take the laxatives that are calling to me. I had to buy a new bottle 2 days ago. The first time the person serving me hasn’t said something like “oh love, you know these are addictive?” & I smile sweetly. “Of course” I say. “They’re not for me, they’re for my grandmother. Can I have a receipt please?” One grandmother is dead, the other I suspect still alive but probably not for much longer. Apparently I met her once when I was a baby.

Before going any further, let me just say that I have nothing but admiration for the skill exhibited there. Further, when it comes to adjusting the tone and colors, and correcting mistakes that the photographer made in setting up the photos, many of these photos needed retouching. The best reason for retouching a photograph is to make the photograph look like the scene looked like–or should have looked like–in real life with the natural eye. And this goes for the models as well. Poor lighting, make up, and photography can make the most beautiful woman look like a hag. In many cases, the original photographer should have done a better job.

So I'm going away for the weekend without my girls and it just feels wrong, wrong, wrong. I know people will say "you need a break" "you're with them all the time"........ The fact is that I really enjoy their company and even though they're no longer small children they still need me (I think!).

We watched, little flowers' heads drooping from our front pockets as Mother's fingers and toes turned black. Mary, her friend, came over to care for her as we children watched our mother cough and writhe in her bed. It seemed like just another spring day when Mother coughed for the last time. The Priest came and told us she was with God. Her body went to be burned though, just like our house and the rest of our neighborhood. We watched it from a hill just a little ways off, our house I mean, burning to the ground. They said it was to get rid of the disease.
My Thoughts: I remember learning about the Titanic in 2nd grade and thinking that it was an incredibly interesting event in history. When the movie came along it just reinforced my interest in the topic. Yes, I was one of those crazy teenagers who saw the movie multiple times in the theatre but I also watched an excessive amount of documentaries and read whatever I could get my hands on about the disaster. Somehow I missed A Night to Remember. It was really neat to read something that was written when there were still a lot of survivors still alive and were able to participate in the writing of the book. I am much more interested in the human aspect of the Titanic story than the more technical side so I really enjoyed how much information the book provided about individuals experiences on the ship.

You're a doctor, not a financial adviser. I expect you to be very good at fixing people when they are broken. If, however, I'm looking to invest some cash for my old age, you're the very last person I'd consider consulting ... because you're a doctor. In fact, having read your words above, I don't even believe I'd be comfortable seeking your medical advice either, po-faced loon that you are.
It’s a fun ride with the right amount of self-referential humour that I love but I guess some people find a little tacky. That said, the action sequences where pretty badass even if they did venture into the supremely ridiculous from time to time. Let’s just say, I wasn’t too fazed until the fighter jet came along and fought Bruce Willis mano-a-mano. Yeeeeaaaaahhh…
Say Hello, Lily by Deborah Lakritz with illustrations by Martha Aviles
A lot of us go about our lives wishing that things were different. Many people become so used to the lives they are leading that they end up being easily bored after a while and dream of living in the past, especially since the world seems to be getting worse and worse. 'Midnight in Paris' -written and directed by Woody Allen - deals with themes of nostalgia and what makes us want more out of life. Woody Allen opens the film with beautiful shots of Paris, showing us that this is a place we should be if we're not already there. Paris is more than a great holiday spot, it's an escape from the world and is a nice, classy environment where very little goes wrong.

When bubbles are thick and the jam spits when stirred, turn off the heat.

When I was young, my country had a financial recession. My parents were small business owners and had employees. During the recession Dad and Mum did everything they could to pay their team first and whatever was left, if anything, was for our family. My parents have amazing stories of miracle provision during that time. I remember several occasions when I came home from school to find a box of groceries on our doorstep. I watched my parents walk out their faith and trust in God. I watched them closely. And I saw the realness of God and His love and care.
The anime, which did not move anywhere near as far into the story as the manga, was charming, has a lovely set of dubbed voice in English and did everything for me the manga did, only in less time. If you're not sure who'd gonna get the girl, the end of the anime gives a pretty strong hint.

Spring here in the arctic is not what you would call pretty. If Winter is a vain, beautiful, mean woman, then spring is an awkward teenager boy covered in acne and all gangly and squeaky. The snow melts and freezes in quick bursts leaving the ground randomly wet and crunchy at the same time. Layers of debris and animal poo and things you didn't realize you left in the snow emerge in ugly glory from what was once white and clean. The willow bushes shed the heavy snow and sit on the horizon looking like a bald mans brand new hair plugs...or maybe barbie hair. Even the dogs scratch miserably at their shedding fur as it falls off in heavy smelly clumps. Early spring is uncomfortable and wonderful at the same time.

The night my son was born, just hours after the ecstasy of birth, I articulated my deepest desire for him, four things: to be healthy, happy, fulfilled, and to live a life of service. Even in the haze of hormones and happiness, these thoughts came fully formed. They coalesced on the night we finally met from the indistinct longings I felt my entire pregnancy, my entire life, for my unborn child.

Every day I would walk over with lunch made either from my tiny little kitchen or from Three Forks Market’s service deli. As much as they appreciated the homemade lunches, I could see the twinkle in their eyes when I would unveil the corn dogs or mini tacos or fried chicken, Jo Jo potatoes and ranch dressing for dipping…all of those good greasy snack foods that tasted oh so delicious but that were oh so unhealthy. And there were days when they would come to the trailer for breakfast too, but those days were very few. Usually Kurt and Joslyn were on the work site bright and early now that our neighbor up the road with the heavy equipment business came down and excavated the hole in the ground in a matter of one full day which completely surprised us. We paid a pretty penny of $2000,00 for his services of digging the hole and removing several huge tree stumps but to this day I feel that it was worth every cent because having that hole in the ground meant that Kurt could get working on the shop.

My theory is that many educators would rather teach their own curriculum or let students design their own curriculum than deliver content designed, sequenced and scaffolded by others. I can understand this sentiment and relate. Having autonomy is a wonderful feeling for teachers and students alike. Just because it feels great and makes you look forward to learning doesn't mean it is the best way to educate an individual, however.

If all this seems a little too “new age” or “out there” for you, it may interest you to know that science is coming to my defense: in a recent “Editor’s Choice” article published in MyNews24, the user-generated section of News24.com, a scientist summarized recent findings about the quantum nature of consciousness which have led researchers to the conclusion that consciousness “is a foundational, irreducible component of reality”; in other words, it exists outside of the body, and therefore may persist from one life to the next.

People love cheesecake. Whether the cheesecake is light and fluffy or dense, is layered with sour cream, topped with fruit, drizzled with caramel or made into chocolate heaven, cheesecake is always a crowd pleaser. There a whole national restaurant chain surrounded around the idea that you WILL have cheesecake for dessert if you eat their. Yet, people are afraid to make them. Ok folks, the secret is out, with a little patience, a rainy evening, a good bottle of wine, and a movie or two you will have a perfect cheesecake. This cheesecake below is my first creation this year with spring flavors. Strawberries picked locally in May and June are given a citrus kick from fresh lemon curd, served with a light and airy vanilla whip cream that seems such a perfect match for summer berries and ice cream sundaes. (And of course my cheesecake).
A most interesting recent quote from Canadian researcher Dr Laurent Mottron about a recently published meta analysis of published functional imaging studies of autistic subjects :

Take this case for example: a recently insured law firm with 24 attorneys. If attorney No.6 failed to show up for work, the cases in progress would not stop but would be reassigned. If attorney No.6 happens to be the primary person that develops new clients for the firm, the disablement of attorney No.6 could easily cause the firm’s collapse.
Thank you for all your comments about Spotty on my last post. He has arthritis in his hind legs, and my concerns with his recent stiffness was that it is getting worse. The exercises are helping and he is getting extra supplements with his feed to help. He is only 9 but pulled a cart or trap before he came to the centre. I suspect he was asked to pull a too heavy load and this could be why he has arthritis. As I own him now, I make sure that he receives the very best care and attention. He is one very loved pony!

Well, apparently I bought the non-browning onions for this recipe. I cooked them on the lowest setting on my stove for 1 hour - no colour. OK, the recipe said 1 hour or more, so I nudged the heat up a little and another 35 minutes passed - no colour. So, now the husband is home and the in laws are on their way over and I have a pot of ghostly onions. Patience lost at this point, I decided to crank up the heat and carry on!
After this they return Ao to his grandfather’s house which has been set ablaze, but even so he still tells Ao not to hate them, leading to him grabbing a photo of his mother and making his decision.

The man turned and shrieked high and wild like tires skidding to and endless stop. His eyes were wide and bloodshot and his bloody fingers clawed wildly at Violet’s face and neck. Violet reached through the whipping arms to slap him hard across his cheek. The shrieking continued. Violet slapped him again and then a third time and the shrieking became a high-pitched scream like the whistle of an impossibly loud tea kettle. Violet pulled back her fist and swung hard at the man’s face. There was a crunching of bones and the scream stopped. The man crumpled to the floor, blood running freely from his nose staining his lab jacket.

The AT&T Center in San Antonio was a fairly standard stadium venue; but, lord, how long has it been since I attended a "stadium concert?" I think, maybe U2 back in the early 90's? I went with an old boyfriend to see James Brown at the Erwin Center, but it was really a fairly small show...not sure if that counts. Anyway, it was big, but the crowd last night was only about 11,000. That seemed strange...I think Houston sold out in like minutes.

Those who know me will often see little 'treasures' on my creations. These may be bits of jewellery, small pieces picked up from ebay, car-boot sales or charity shop finds, and I have a couple of small boxes filled with old watch pieces, game pieces, vintage sewing things, vintage ephemera, keys, frozen charlotte dolls, bottle tops as well as new things like the TH Idea-ology range.
Last week in Jacksonville, I woke up at the beach to the sound of birds chirping, waves crashing and the peaceful bliss of a sunshiny day. I shuffled into the kitchen to brew a fresh pot of coffee. While admiring my collection of newly gathered seashells my eyes wandered to the carton of Land O Lakes Fat Free Half & Half – “Our half & half contains no preservatives or artificial flavors.” Awe, how nice, I thought.
But then that ends the list. I have seen great friendships. I’d say I am a good friend too. Not that I have the right to judge myself but then again, no one knows my heart and my circumstances like I do. I have no ego unless forged or forced or situationally placed. I have seen ever lasting loyalty too. But I have also seen it fail. For no reason at all. Sometimes with mutual understanding and at other times as a result of ego. But today I can say I have “truly” grown up… or matured. If I was in the position I am in now, say six years ago, I’d be all over the place. But being aware of the farce truth and smiling and realising it rather than being sprawled over the floor surrounded by habitants of a tissue box- to me is growth and maturity.

At the age of 18, I wanted to find my birth family. Not because I wanted my birth mother to be a mother to me or to replace my adoptive parents, but because I wanted, NEEDED answers. I involved my Mum and Dad from the start. Dad did not want much involvement as he was afraid I would get hurt, maybe from rejection again. Even before I saw an adoption counsellor I had gone through every possible scenario in my head. Some of the scenarios I thought of were:
Most investors, however, have presumed that their own abundance and prosperity would be safe… to such an extent that they did not look at the cards before placing their bets (bids) on aggressive speculation in real estate. But that is just the start of what I mean by oblivious.

So after 8 days of nothing but milk, water and a small cup of coffee each day, you’d think that I had more than sprouted corn tortillas and raw organic almonds around for my first meal. I didn’t plan very well for coming out of the fast. Strangely as much as I’d craved food or chewing really, during the first part of the cleanse, I do not relish having to think about cooking, plan meals or carry around a lot of stuff to make sure I eat properly. When it comes down to it, eating well (with dietary restrictions) in NYC or just about anywhere in America is a VERY DIFFICULT task and requires a lot of forethought, planning, lots of glassware or insulated stainless steel containers and a strong back to cary it all on.

Kind of like..they forget how Boko Haram and Taliban commit horrible acts against Muslims and non Muslims alike when confront with the less pleasing realities of Islam. How when they promote Islam as a religion of peace, they forget how their beloved prophet raped children, tortured and murdered thousands of people. Either by his hand or command. It really is an honest mistake to forget that these things ever happened.

When the tests came up negative, I suggested returning them immediately, so their mother might hunt them something while it was still night.

Ultimately what we’re left with is the next chapter in the gallant Bassnectar series. As his crowds have grown from bars and clubs to huge venues and arenas, his music has advanced immensely as well. Just like the Beatles, Bassnectar’s albums are not all a precise representation of exactly what he is, but that is what makes him, and the Beatles, fantastic. He is constantly reinventing himself, pushing limitations and creating fresh sounds. Along with a great attitude and incredible live performance, Bassnectar has once again proven why he is a robot lion in this EDM kingdom.

19. Who we are
I called the parents on Christmas day. I hadn't gotten a period so we pretty much knew what to expect. I dipped the stick and almost immediately it changed to positive. Both parents were of course ecstatic. Those first few weeks are so nerve wracking. We were onto yet another next step, but of course we still had more waiting to do. I tested everyday just to make sure it was STILL positive. We got the first blood test results back (which was taken at 4 weeks of pregnancy) and the levels were at 265. That's a good amount, but what we really needed to see was it going up. The next blood test was at 5 weeks of pregnancy. These hormone levels were through the roof at a whopping 3816!!! Woo! Those are wonderful numbers! That left us with the nagging question of is it one or two??? Not only were those numbers quite high for a singleton pregnancy, but I was also beginning to show already! I had to keep reminding myself that it had only been a year since I had my youngest daughter and this is also my third pregnancy. My body may respond a lot quicker this time. The questions were just killing me! The unknowns and the what ifs. It was really nerve wracking. It feels so nice to actually KNOW something. Seeing that one amniotic sac on the ultrasound screen really washed away all the stress that I had been feeling. It has been a long few months waiting and more waiting, but now we are finally here!

U.S. public ranked among the world’s most enthusiastic supporters of international law (falling just behind the Germans and the Chinese in global surveys), it now appears that vast majorities of Americans reject the applicability of international law when it comes to the actions of the U.S. government in the “global war on terror.”
I was there when you had your laptop background picture of 'Cheryl' in my mothers own family house. I was there sitting on the table when my grandmother was so in tears that my auntie had to translate from Chinese to English. "We trusted her with you. We trusted you! How could you do this to her?" My grandmother hates you. She says that my mother has a big heart, too big of a heart. You take advantage of that. It's true, you do. If you can't, you just create drama. With me. With my younger sister. You thrive off it.
These eye openers, fog cutters, and morning glories came in many forms and included almost anything that could potentially soften the effects of a hangover. Therefore, the ingredients were often a matter of taste. Perhaps the chosen cure combined a bit of milk and sugar mixed with your morning dram. After absinthe became popular, it often found its way into many anti-fogmatics, mostly because of its refreshing flavor and stomach settling powers. Its extreme potency was usually tamed with some sweetener and ice. Other pick-me-ups revolved around citrus and employed its tart flavors, not to mention the natural sugars and vitamins, to help bring the sparkle back to eyes clouded over with heaviness. The truth is that when strong morning tipples were common--and we're not talking about today's tame bloody marys and mimosas--everything was fair game. An entire category of drinks, with clever monikers, was devoted to helping the masses face a new day, often in spite of the one before.

2. Give as much as you take. I can credit social media directly for finding me my last two jobs, for creating at least a dozen of my closest friendships, for uncovering what became some of my favorite social events, and for rewarding me with a variety of awesome prizes and swag. That said, I’ve used it to help others find jobs, locate lost pets, spread the word about charitable events, and much more. The best way to get someone to help you is to first help them.
I don't think it's necessary to try to do the MOST possible. I think society needs to learn to be content with ENOUGH. Our kids have never been without food or shelter or access to medicine, and neither have I. We're already more privileged... than much of the world's population. Why do Westerners need sooo much in order to be happy? And even though we have sooo much, so many of us are unhappy, anyway.
This week for Card Creating Sunday, I am showing you the cutest Christmas card! I saw the directions online at Splitcoaststampers.com (Pyramid Card by Kirsteen Gill). I just thought it was adorable and easy to make. I tweaked a few things to make it my own so to speak. I used Twinkle Toes for the tree skirt and the squares were cut at 3.75" from Plantin Schoolbook. I added lots of holes with my Crop-O-Dile and then added bling! The gathered ribbon around the based of the tree skirt is actually paper I accordion folded and glued down. I do recommend using Terrifically Tacky Tape to hold down the completed tree skirt. Have fun and enjoy!
Here's what I expect:
As you can see, there are many benefits of using pencils with markers, just remember to use the pencils after you're done with your marker layers. Colored pencils are waxy, and the wax is worse than just plain graphite when it comes to clogging and discoloring your marker tips. Just to be thorough, I tested putting colored pencil down first then going over it with an old blender marker. Good thing I used an old tip because it really ruined it. No matter how quickly I scribbled to clean off my tip it was stained badly. Sure, it blended a little bit, smoothed a little bit, but it wasn't worth ruining a good marker tip over.
Saute spice mix with some cooking oil, stirring constantly on medium heat until oil separates (~15 to 20 minutes) then add in plum sauce and the rest of the ingredients. Check for seasonings, it should be spicy, sweet, sour and extremely fragrant.
In fact, aside from the first chapter’s colour pages, the last chapter’s ONE colour page, the animated adaptations I mentioned, volume covers, and some side-material, this is the only piece of colour artwork the series has gotten despite the really high quality drawings Akamatsu has given us:
“The Gold Watch” opens with the memory which places the extraordinary importance of the talisman with both the boxer and the audience. The boxer wakes from this like it’s a nightmare. He then pulls off his scam and safely escapes. There will be no possibility of conflict between him and the kingpin, he has escaped, and is in a safe place. In the middle of this sequence, the boxer wakes again from a horrible dream, presumably, again, of the gold watch. He sees the violence on TV, what the audience expects and wants from these types in conflict. There is no reason for the boxer to leave his safe place – except for this implanted memory, designed for the purpose of him going on what would otherwise be an irrational quest – the retrieval of a simple watch from his house, even if it means great possibility of harm, but which will fulfill the ends of the structure: bringing him into conflict with the kingpin. When I see the boxer wake from his nightmare each time, I see a reaction not just to the memory itself, but that the memory is there almost arbritrarily, alone, in order to drive him into conflict. It is something like a science fiction film, where a character’s memories have been implanted so he acts according to the purposes of some shadowy, sinister group, the character vaguely aware that there is something of design, something not entirely his own, to these memories.
There are alternative fuel sources like natural gas. Mr. Ednurseasauras had already scheduled an electrician to install a transfer switch in the basement so that 6 or 7 different electrical...things... could be run off the generator without using 20 extension cords. Unfortunately, it was scheduled for the day after we got our power back, but hey, we are all set if it happens again. That, and the 40 gallons of gas he plans to have just in case.

VERDICT: Do I feel a crispy crunch as I bite? Yes! Do I get that chewy center? Yes, indeed! Is it underbaked? No! What I taste is vanilla custard. The butter isn't overpowering, but it's there. This cookie is just like that one I used to buy at that cookie place. These are excellent! Now, I had visions of wrapping pretty colored ribbon around a stack of these, and photographing them. Only, I was losing my natural light. I decided to shoot photos the next day. Well, that wasn't going to happen... let's just say that out of the 24 cookies, there were four left! I'd say that the men in my life liked them.

I carry three flashlights, because I am too poor to buy the LED flashlight that the cops use. One day, when we are out of the recession, I might purchase one with my work salary. I can’t find a job right now, but when times get better, I will find a good job and have plenty of money for supplies.
I loved getting to know Cat’s team. The men are rough and tough and it was interesting to see them at a point where Cat had a new member. It showed the testaments she needed to make to gain trust from the men, but also assured the reader that she was accepted as their leader as well as a friend. Watching the final team member slowly integrate and trust Cat was almost like watching a relationship develop…Gave you the new relationship feeling that was missing from Cat and Bones. Mostly because Cat and Bones aren’t new.

Sasu Ripatti, who has been recording solo electronic music as Vladislav Delay for some time now, here tries something different by assembling a live band to play a largely acoustic set that sounds a bit like a jazz band doing dark ambient. Ripatti himself plays drums, Lucio Capece contributes howls and long whistling tones on soprano sax and bass clarinet, Derek Shirley drives the music along with throbbing double bass, and Mika Vainio adds the only electronic contributions. The music is dark and sinister, creeping along at a plodding pace like a movie monster inexorably pursuing its prey. Ripatti's percussion is largely sparse, providing a slow rhythmic underpinning with tinkling cymbals, while the other musicians craft grim soundscapes from electronic noise, bassy rumble and the eerie sounds of Capece's horns, sometimes processed and blurred, sometimes play acoustically with just his breath whistling through the instrument, not quite sounding a note. The entire album is great, but the clear highlight is the 12-minute "Santa Teresa," a foreboding death march that, I'd like to think, provides a tribute through its title and its haunting atmosphere to the fictional and violent Mexican city of Roberto Bolaño's epic novel 2666.

I often hope that maybe the seizures will go away;
my skin. I may have lived an ordinary existence, but I can fight.
Maybe that's a clue to the truth: for the time being at least, there are going to be those who prefer one or the other; I've even heard people say they like both, but for different purposes: e.g. paper for books to treasure, and electronic for books to take on holiday.
Katrina and the ensuing collapse of schools, home life and other support structures likely played a role, says Lance Hill, executive director of the New Orleans-based Southern Institute for Education and Research, who has tracked crime trends. Children displaced by the floods returned with their families to a wrecked city, bounced from school to school and lacked mental health professionals to help them through the trauma, he says.

The punters mostly want wheat and fruit beers. Some are very knowledgeable indeed and ask for the serious lambics, Hanssens and Girardin. Others just want something fruity. Girardin is the only frambozen we have and it sells out very fast indeed. We had some plain gueuze and strawberry gueuze from Hanssens, but they disappeared so quickly that I’m not sure any more that I ever saw them to begin with.

Anyway, my original inspiration for this recipe was, naturally, bananas going bad on our counter. Also, this recipe from The Crepes of Wrath. This recipe looked reeeeally good. Except I don't like coconut (not shredded coconut anyway, I like the flavour though!) or dried pineapple. Or raisins in my baking. Uhhh. But I still thought it looked great and interesting. Especially since I was trying to use up bananas and we had fresh pineapple in the fridge. Of course, my recipe is far far different, so it's posted below.

I stayed up until 2 a.m. listening to that cd and it hasn't left my cd player since. I truly believe it is her best work yet. Taylor Swift is quite literally fearless in this album, she sings about all the things she wishes she would have said and that most of us are too afraid to say in everyday life (or at least I happen to be). I full well know that every time I started to date a cute guy, someone I really liked, I had that moment where I imagined this very elaborate future (MINE). Of course I would never dream of saying to him, "my God I just saw our wedding in my head, it was great. Oh and P.S. we are going to have ten adorable super model babies". Or how about when you just meet someone, for the very first time, and you simply can't get them out of your head and it makes you so giddy you dance around in your room (ENCHANTED). Then there's that guy, the one you let go, and at the time you were so sure of your decision, but now that he's gone you can't stop thinking about what you lost (BACK TO DECEMBER). Of course telling him you were wrong would require swallowing your pride and let's say you actually decided to come clean, well he could always slam the door in your face. Wouldn't that be a bundle of joy?

Many times I visit blogs where I have to look for the "follow" button. I've also visited blogs that have their store information below the fold and in so doing the reader is not likely to see it much less take action. Blogs are selling tools and we as the "designer" must place our action tools where our customers can readily see and act.
I have already said that I think it is mistaken to say “There is a logically possible world in which only God exists” (though I find myself hoping that I am wrong about this). However, let’s grant for the sake of argument that God alone exists in some logically possible world. what then of propositions such as “I exist”? Can God know “I exist” to be true of himself? I’m not sure that language can exist without a world, but of course I have granted for the sake of argument that God existing alone is sufficient for a ‘possible world’ – so perhaps God could know that ‘I exist’ is true. What, then, of the proposition “God is omnipresent”? Does God himself know that the proposition “God is omnipresent” is true? It entails, after all, that God recognizes himself, from the third-person perspective, to have the property of being omnipresent (of course, defining omnipresence is itself a tricky thing, as Aquinas wanted to do it with reference to God’s power, and others have sought to do it with God’s occupancy of/at all regions). However, in a world where ‘regions’ do not exist, since nothing like space (or ‘relations between phenomenal bodies’) exists, it is hard to imagine omnipresence being true of anything (let alone ‘presence’ being true of anything). Therefore, doesn’t it seem as though the proposition “God, in all possible worlds at which only God exists, knows that the proposition ‘God is omnipotent‘ is true.” is simply meaningless, or else false?

I wasn't able to take as many photos as I would have liked because it was too dangerous to be running around with a camera in public during the war for anyone - imagine if an American was caught taking pictures.

We packed our overnight bags, got into the little car and started to head to the hills. Our destination – Peppers Ruffles Lodge & Spa, in the Gold Coast Hinterland.
The scape is naturally beautiful. I am in love with its whimsical style. I love how they curl around into a double helix, the long thin closed blossom, how they looked bunched and how they bloom. I save one bunch for a vase just to watch them bloom. Eventually the snaking scape stands up completely straight and opens up to a myriad of small balls, much like it’s cousin the onion.
As a part of our anatomy
I went for a run along the route early this morning, before the streets were completely closed down. As I run, I realize that downtown is only a 30 min jog from our front steps. I run at the edge of the street, where cars usually park. The streets have been transformed into wide, tree-lined avenues–all because of the absence of parked cars. Even through there are scattered cars driving (a little confusedly) down the road, I begin to feel that these are my streets.

A couple of weeks ago on our way to the airport to head to Boulder, we stopped by a house that had come on the market the day before in our ideal area. As I mentioned here, 23 other people also looked at the same house the same day. I have no clue how many people total looked at the house. There is nothing coming on the market in this particular area, and this confirms that there are a bunch of other buyers who are just queuing up.
Then when we got home, we harvested another big bowl of kale from the garden - so tonight's dinner will be a stir fry of kale, bok choy, onion, garlic, and chicken - with a cucumber salad on the side. I'm hungry already!!

So 13 days in and Spoil of War is still free, despite my best efforts to unfree it.

Apple still has it listed for free.

Our Volunteers. Our Superheroes. They work in all areas of volunteering at Friends of Hospice Ottawa; in-home visits, special events, transportation, caregiver support, bereavement support, day hospice, office, knitting, baking, special events, PR, web support and more. Our volunteers are truly today’s superheroes who often work in the shadows - behind the scenes, their deed un-noticed except by those they serve and by those they serve with.

GUARDIAN/Paul Doyle - A season in statistics: the Premier League campaign in numbers
When I heard about this new development at the Piggly Wiggly Country Village I got excited. I had visions of a large scale conundrum of twisting trails, confusing crossroads and frustrating dead ends. Sadly, I was a little disappointed. In reality, it is fairly easy to navigate the narrow maize paths and the only real concerns are a slap in the eye from an encroaching mealie stalk or the threat of being bowled over by a swarm of sprinting children.
The three white butterflies (often known as cabbage whites) will very shortly be in evidence (Large White, Small White and Green-veined White) and then the season is really under way.

I started on the bottom part first, before I really knew where the piece was going as a whole. I knew it was going to be about 'palimpsest' and 'language', but beyond that, my idea had yet to gel. I was hoping that it would reveal itself as I proceeded. After scratching and scraping and rubbing paint into the surface, I cut the book cloth and ripped a big hunk of it off, then stuck part of an old piece into the hole (yes, 'hunk', 'hole', and 'stuck' are the correct technical terms). I glued things on, ripped things off, scraped, peeled, and transferred. I did lots of this for a long time, and can't really remember what came first, next, or before. It was very therapeutic!
I began by quickly peeling and dicing the winter squash. The trick is to peeling a hard winter squash is to use a really good vegetable peeler. Once your squash is free of its tough skin, halve it, and grab a spoon to scoop out the seeds and the stringy mess inside.

The biggest reason I believe that everyone can lose weight and be healthy is because I did it. A glance into my past and you’ll see that for the past 24 years of my life I have struggled with my weight. Never once did I step on a scale and have it say I was anything but overweight, I’m not over being dramatic either. I started my first bought of weight watchers when I was in the 5th grade and I weighed 210 pounds. It worked, and I lost a good chunk of weight. Sadly, in 8th grade I got diagnosed with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (a autoimmune disease where your thyroid is attacked) and ended up gaining most if it back before I could figure out why I was gaining all this weight. I stopped myself before reaching 200. Since then I have shifted the scale between the 180′s and 190′s.
I send the Writing Survey home with my students as their first bit of Writing Workshop homework, and they have a weekend to complete it. For the first few years of teaching sixth grade, the survey I cobbled together using Nancie Atwell as a guide was fourteen questions long...too long. Many surveys came back with one line answers - especially from those students who who were struggling writers. More importantly, I didn't learn very much from these hurried responses. I'd read them through, learn a few things about a few students, and file them away.

As seen from the last half of the chapters, this is a Masechet that deals with some rather serious issues, namely those of capital punishment, but – maybe surprisingly at first thought – also on some much more issues, namely on the subjects of establishing, organizing and outlining rules for the courts. The reason for these being more important, is found in the fact that without courts, there would be no court rulings, and without rules for those rulings, there would be now red line to follow, when making rulings. So by this the justice of the court is (hopefully) established, and we can look closer on the rules that the courts have to rule after.

They were so excited to have a shack of their own and tears of joy were shed as she exclaimed “we have our very own shack now, just like everyone else.”

Thomas Edison and Tesla were mentioned in a press dispatch as potential laureates to share the Nobel Prize of 1915, leading to one of several Nobel Prize controversies. Some sources have claimed that because of their animosity toward each other neither was given the award, despite their scientific contributions; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; and that both rejected any possibility of sharing it. – Wikipedia

The next step in the book is creating the farce (or stuffing) for the skins, then stuffing them, wrapping them in caul fat, and cooking them before serving them on a bed of green lentils. However, I knew the pieces of skin were too small (the largest, most intact one was 2x3") so I knew I couldn't finish this dish the way I had planned to, so I had to improvise and figure out something else. I decided to just serve the pig feet meat (great name for a band by the way, "Ladies and gentlemen, I give you: Piiiiiiiiiiig Feeeeeeeeet Meeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaat!!!!!!!!!!") over lentils. I thought it would taste pretty good.
"Maybe you could check Facebook, see if you posted anything on those days," my boss suggested. No, I said to her, it would take way too long to go that far back to see what I had tweeted on those days in question (same with Twitter, too...because I have my Twitter feed linked up to my Facebook account). But then, after thinking about it and temporarily blaming my less-than-ideal work schedule for getting me into this mess, I was struck with inspiration: What had I blogged on or around those certain days?

I also believe in the allure of a woman. This is something that our younger ladies are not being taught. It is not dragging your feet around in flip flops or wearing revealing clothes. It is looking in the mirror and liking what you see. It is holding a little something back from the male persuasion. It is eye contact and not letting them see your fear. It is being able to say no to that fashion faux pair. ( I have never been one that believes knitwear makes a women look great). It is creating your own sense of style and developing a wardrobe over the years to show that.

In the state leaders meeting of the BRICS just closed in New Delhi, India proposed a series of positive proposals, hoping deepening the relations of the BRICS, strengthening cooperative mechanism of these countries and enlarging the role of the international economy and political life of these countries, which again embodies India’s all-round diplomatic policy. Therefore, it is groundless to think its “Look East Policy” and the American strategy of eastward transfer are converging.
I believe it is fundamentally wrong on many levels, we should never be forced to change the Irish Constitution by any foreign power, this treaty will be the final nail in the coffin of Irish Sovereignty and I firmly believe that our politicians will use it as an excuse for everything.

In March a Financial Times article was titled “Bleak Outlook for U.S. Newspapers” and called them “America’s fastest-shrinking industry.” Advertising revenues are half what they were in 2005 and now at 1984’s levels. Part of the challenge has come from the growth of the Internet as the go-to source for news, but part can be attributed to the loss of confidence in the objectivity and accuracy of what newspapers, with exceptions, report as news or fail to report entirely. For those like myself who began his career as a reporter and editor, that is sad news, but Christopher B. Daly, a veteran journalist and historian, has just had a splendid book published, Covering America: A Narrative History of a Nation’s Journalism ($49.95, University of Massachusetts Press) that will please its readers on many levels. Daly remains optimistic, noting that American journalism has always been challenged, going through deep change in the 1830s and again in the 1920s. Daly provides a lively, interesting review of journalism’s many personalities, events and trends. It is an excellent work of history concerning the profession and business of journalism, filled with anecdotes and intriguing facts. It surely belongs on the shelves everywhere journalism is celebrated.
I will be THAT mom today! I will be THAT mom who forgives herself for having some bumps in the road and being the OTHER mom for the past few weeks. Thank you to all you wonderful moms and dads who wrote in and gave me a bit of a slap in the face.
The latest episode, of course, features cute Nezumi-Shion moments, but it’s probably the first episode that makes me think about deeper things than “oh, how cute is Nezumi”. And this is a good thing, when an anime series becomes intriguing and confusing. Now I am eager to watch the next episode, but, boy, do I have to wait.
So what Hitler, Mussolini and Peron all show is what most modern-day Leftist intellectuals passionately deny: That you can be an extreme Leftist and an extreme nationalist too. And it shows something very troubling too: That the combination of Leftism and nationalism is POPULAR! The popularity of that combination is also shown in the way Germans fought to the end for Hitler. Perhaps we should be thankful that modern-day Leftists (who are often anything but patriotic) have not learned all that their Fascist brethren might have taught them.
UMNO/BN has been holding events/ceramah while promising voters that if they are return to power, they will honour all their promises. At the same time UMNO/BN claims that they are the "tested" lot, since they were the government since Independence.
The last book I got was The Last Princess by Galaxy Craze. This one is a dystopia that takes place in England and is centered around a young princess who is the only survivor after a revolutionary who makes the royal family his first target.
A psychiatrist work is dangerous in a way.It is-because whenever you are treating a person who is psychologically disturbed, in a mess,he is constantly broadcasting his vibes.He is constantly throwing out his own energy,his negative waves upon you and you have to listen to him.You have to be very attentive.You have to care,you have to love and be compassionate towards him;only then you can help him.He is constantly throwing negative-charged energy-and you are absorbing it.In fact the more attentively you listen,the more you absorb it.
7And went on preaching the good news there.
I started with a base of Very Vanilla, layered with White (edge pierced) and topped with some new Kimberly Polson Paper (Fiskars). The long rectangle at the top is the flipside of the same paper, matted in white and then again on Very Vanilla and scalloped the bottom edge (SU punch) and added some white Kaiser pearls to the corner. The main image is from SU's 'Always' set, stamped in Versamark and embossed in white EP on VV card, matted on white and pierced the edges. The flower is made up of three white Kaiser flowers, layered and a pearl brad from Little Yellow Bicycle was added to the centre. Finally I added the sentiment, which is actually a sticker from the co-ordinating Kimberly Polson range. I don't normally 'do' stickers, but I liked these. :)
But the power of us tethers my heart to yours, a choking kind of love more powerful than this hate. I know these things you feel are too much, that you need me to help you. If this is the need that must be filled as you heal, if you need to destroy the happiness who used to glow ‘neath my skin… Surely it’s better than destroying yourself.
The pericope begins by introducing a crisis of leadership in the king of Jerusalem’s concern over his own city in light of Joshua’s violence against Jericho, Ai, and their kings. The king becomes “greatly frightened” at the idea of a Gibeon-Israel alliance. He acts out immediately to defend his territory by gathering an alliance of four Amorite kings to his south. According to suzerain-vassal conventions, Gibeon had become an enemy of the Amorites because Israel was their enemy. Two other Amorite kings, Sihon and Og, had already been defeated by Israel. The text condenses the actions of the Amorite kings as they gather, go up, and attack Gibeon in order to bring the reader to the real conflict: will Joshua uphold the peace treaty he had been tricked into signing?
The whole flock is looking forward to this Saturday’s Salsa festivities. We chickens have developed a fondness for those spicy Doritos that you all serve with hot sauce! Yummy! These things are even crunchier than deep fried crickets, which are quite a delicacy! Crickets are best served with a sweet, rather than hot sauce; just in case you ever try them. Crickets come highly recommended!
Food is an important part of culture. The definition of culture can be summed like this; culture is the product of a group of people who share common attitudes, values, goals, and practices which results in certain knowledge, belief, and behavior. Now you’re asking where does food come in to the picture. Everywhere, I’d say. Food is not only «putting gas into your engine», but also a way to socialize. It is influenced by religion. What you eat is to some extent decided by where you live.

ANGELA: Please stop it, you know. There’s no reason to do this. Because it’s, it’s not necessary. She is going to have a tough life, with all these children. She is going to be punished. She believes in God so, you know, God is gonna take care of all this.
the chances of it all happening once were so very low that i can't see how the universe would bring it on again but tonight i saw quite a coincidence so it would probably wise if i never thought of it all again.

If I'm right, what you're left with is this: an existing group of readers and subscribers who feel the publications have abandoned them (case in point: the ego-fulfilling guest columns from industry figures have gone by the way side, I'm told) -- and another market that is served quite well elsewhere -- because people in media love nothing more than to write about themselves.
Another character I liked hearing about is Tom Riddle. It is always interesting to hear more about him (him being Lord Voldermort). Seeing that he is reaching out even as he is in this weakened state.
On the birth certificate released by the White House, the listed place of birth is "Kapi'olani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital". This cannot be, because the hospital(s) in question in 1961 were called "KauiKeolani Children's Hospital" and "Kapi'olani Maternity Home", respectively. The name did not change to Kapi'olani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital until 1978, when these two hospitals merged. How can this particular name of the hospital be on a birth certificate dated 1961 if this name had not yet been applied to it until 1978?.
I couldn't wipe the grin off my face! Patrice knew I'd been letting the turkey's get me down...or so to speak, and this was such a thoughtful thing to do. I felt so special, and I sat down on Friday night and made some happy pages to start my first-ever Smash album. Thanks so much Patrice...you really did make an average week feel like a really smashing one :-)
10. The tastiest part of this recipe… buttercream. Soften the butter in a bowl, and add the sifted icing sugar. Cream together until smooth and light. Now add the vanilla and food colouring of your own preference… I chose pink simply because it’s pretty and looks glorious against gold.
For your own sake, you cannot let yourself get used to people adjusting their actions because of your irritability. If everybody did that, you would come to expect it, and that's how egomaniacs are born.

Not to mention that the film is essentially perfect—script, acting, direction, camera all working together perfectly—I could tell this even from a pan&scan tape, but it was still a joy to have it confirmed by a gift from Toestubber of the Spanish letterboxed DVD.
While not approved as a dietary supplement by the FDA, lutein is ubiquitous in foods. It may play an important role in maintaining vision and preventing such eye diseases as ARMD and cataracts, the two leading causes of vision loss in adults. The carotenoid may accomplish this by protecting eye tissue from free radical damage and shielding the eyes from potentially destructive sunlight.
So Britain had an empire and Britain did slavery. Boo hoo. Deal with it. Move on. Slavery ended here over two hundred years ago. More recently, there were tens of millions of innocents enslaved or killed in Europe by the twin industrialised evils of Nazism and Stalinism. My own first cousins—twin brothers aged sixteen—died down a Soviet salt mine. I need no lecture on eggplants and neck-irons. Most of us are descendants of both oppressors and oppressed; most of us get over it. Mind you, I am tempted by thoughts of compensation from Scandinavia for the wickedness of its Viking raids and its slaving-hub on the Liffe. As for the 1066 invasion of England by William the Bastard…
AG: Yes, this is a very, very good question; we have to understand it very deeply. The problem is that in this pursuit, this particular pursuit of science, including the books that we mentioned earlier, The Tao of Physics and TheDancing Wu Li Masters, even when spirituality is recognized within the materialist worldview, God is seen only in the immanent aspect of divinity. What that means is: you have said that there is only one reality.
I just watched "The Switch" on tv while I ate my lunch and now I'm sitting here, irritated about life but I'm not depressed so I don't feel sorry for myself. I just feel.... like.... AAAAHHH is the best way to put it. I can't form a concentrated thought and I'm too physically tired to do anything like going out to play with my camera and take some pictures. I'm still learning how to use this camera- it's really, really nice and for pros so I'm like, not sure how to use it. My dad handed it down after he bought his new one this year. Though mine is still being sold and all that, it's not old at all. But anyway, I grew up using a film camera like all of us, and I haven't made the switch to digital except for with my candid camera that I carry around for social stuff. I'm used to changing the settings myself for the lighting and not letting the camera do it for me.

3. Books. I am really enjoying reading Cold Light by Frank Moorhouse (very slowly). Yet my most amazing moment with books happened earlier this year. I had just finished reading a novel and found a picture that looked exactly as I thought the main character might look. I emailed the picture to my sister who knows the author and passed it on. The author wrote back to say yes that is her, without the glasses. If only I had a hotline to authors of other books I read to check I am on the right track.

My local Joann had reduced the regular price on a number of their small kits to $3.99; since it was the regular price, coupons also worked, so I picked up a couple more kits. I did start on Happiness, but the character is charted and not marked on the canvas at all and I did not choose the center properly; I may work the red outline using the picture as a chart and then count from there to start it from the top.

The convents that sheltered and educated the women were closed. This increased the number of poor and unprotected women. Any effort to lend them moral and financial support was resisted by the men. Since there were no trained doctors around, people turned to the wise women who used herbs to cure their ailments. The common herbs used in medicines, brews, ointments and potions were mandrake, datura, monkshood, belladonna, henbane and hemlock.

The book follows the reactions of both families. This disposition awakens in Chrissie a sense of further insecurity, one that has always existed, since he refused a divorce and never married her. In fact, although she wears a wedding ring, it is one she bought herself. She is hostile toward Margaret and Scott and doesn’t even want them to attend the funeral. She has also been left to pay taxes that she would not otherwise have been liable for, so her family will have to make do with less money.
And, as with Hidden, there is hope at the end. I imagine these titles are immensely popular with teen readers, because there is no gilding of the lily; Miriam Halahmy was a special needs teacher for many years in London and knows what she is talking about. I'll be looking forward to Stuffed, the third book in the cycle.

I know that God’s strength is greater than my weakness, which is greatly reassuring, as my weaknesses are great and many. So, I pray for the wherewithal to allow God to take charge, and to be my strength, overcoming my weaknesses; giving me the freedom and strength to prioritise God, and the courage to put my hand up and say, “Yes! I have seen God. He is in everyone.”
"Now how does this infinite divine beauty relate to our longing for beauty? I do believe that deeply rooted in every human heart is a longing for beauty... Is it not because we long to behold and be a part of beauty? We crave to be moved by some rare glimpse of greatness. We yearn for a vision of glory." ~ John Piper, Jesus Is Precious Because We Yearn for Beauty

But wait! There’s more! In the original Italian, many of the jokes depend on the impenetrable regional dialects that define the characters, as when Pantalone’s crotchety Venetian collides with Arlecchino’s rustic burr from Bergamo while the lovers coo in elegant Tuscan. And then there’s the foreigner Capitano who butchers his Italian, often to uproariously obscene effect. Rather than trying to adapt American dialects – say Pantalone with a Southern drawl or a Dottore from Harvard Square – it is more effective to have the servant spout contractions and vulgarities, the elders gabble in persnickety patter, and the lovers proclaim passion in heartbreaking lyrical verse.
Let us put it this way: you have a driver's license (that you supposedly got a hold on after giving an exam) and a car. In this case, does anybody drive your sorry ass to where you want to go? No, you drive yourself, because you can! Also, keyboard players are sexy.
Stunned, Kelly mindlessly flipped through the channels on her TV trying to find a distraction. But the only thing that seemed to help was her cat, Stevie T (short for Stephen Tyler). He was curled up on her lap, purring away. Kelly stroked the long yellow fur on the tabby whose only purpose in life was to sleep, eat, and soak up attention. She scratched behind his ears. “Wish I was you,” she said. The cat opened his green eyes slightly and let out a soft meow, likely in protest that Kelly had spoken. “Sorry.”

What the hell is all of this plot doing in my Dwayne Johnson movie? Get with the program, folks – people don’t drag themselves out of the house on a chilly Thanksgiving day to watch a couple of guys wrestle with existential crises. They do it so that they can see the Rock blow a whole bunch of holes in a whole bunch of people. Thankfully, Faster isn’t entirely devoid of this type of action, and, as usual, Johnson is perfectly happy to play ball.
Plasma is looked upon as the ‘fourth state of matter’, different from solid, liquid, gas. And as plasma is almost exclusively electromagnetic –a cluster of ionized particles– electrical theory is being unwrapped from the closet and given another airing.

And he brought up a very good point. He said usually we can discuss things because it's not like we're doing it every day and it's much easier for things to "happen" when it's not an everyday occurence. YOU KNOW?
After having a great weekend with Christian friends things are on a high for a while and then down the next week. I'm reminded now of the song "Party"! Good times here on earth are just a reminder of what it'll be up there. So for now, let's enjoy the good times we have and if anyone is struggling, just hold on and God will provide. "Oh the answer will come but only in His time, stand still and let God move".

“What are the results we may gain from the prayer meeting? They are five: original thought on religious subjects; open committal to the cause of Christ; the helpful expression of Christian thought and experience; the cultivation of the spirit of worship through public prayer and through singing; the guidance of others along these lines of service and life.

Author P.J. Haarsma built a game which attracted a huge audience that became the core supporters of his books. The game community helped test storylines and championed the books to their friends, too.The women behind Readergirlz have built a community around authors, books, and reading. The site is a destination offering interactivity, changing content, and projects that involve offline participation, as well. While the site is not directly about the Readergirlz “divas” themselves, the connection to the readers still exists for them individually as well as collectively.

I do feel bad for the author, who is probably paying a premium for this inept service--but on the other hand, I suspect he may not have done his homework.
The links between the Order and Britain go through Lazard Freres and the private merchant bankers. Notably the British establishment also founded a University – Oxford University, and especially All Souls College at Oxford. The British element is called ‘The Group’. The Group links to the Jewish equivalent through the Rothschilds in Britain (Lord Rothschild was an original member of Rhodes’ ‘inner circle’). The Order in the US links to the Guggenheim, Schiff and Warburg families… There is an Illuminati connection.

You can't say you would have killed her on one hand, then profess love for her on the other. It's morally repugnant and an insult to her as a basic human being. Fortunately for their daughter, she will probably never be fully able to comprehend the fact that her parents wish they could have aborted her.

Yes, HUGE circles or "roller coasters" as the boys explain to me on the hall wall and small areas in Trevor's and Brody's room. I couldn't believe it, but I did have to laugh a little. Thank goodness for Magic Eraser even though it doesn't do a great job and kind of takes off some of the paint - maybe that's because we have flat paint on our walls. The funny thing is that my dad was there and he really thought he would be painting the walls that weekend. Not yet dad, but it's coming soon.

What I realized after the liquor store incident is that my inability to move on, at some level, as evidenced by my ridiculous response to seeing him, isn’t about a lack of forgiveness; it isn’t even about anger: it’s about self-protection. I just didn’t want to get hurt again, so I ran away.
For a long time, I didn’t buy or make Valentine’s cards for our kids to give out to their class. My eldest son didn’t care or ask for such things until he was older (and could do it on his own), and I always thought it was a bit silly. Why would a 5 year old send a love note to anyone but his family? And at our kids’ school, if you’re going to send a Valentine you have to send them to everyone in the class. I understand the premise (no one gets left out), but it’s always seemed like a bit of a landfill issue to me. What do you do with all those slips of paper covered in Spiderman and Iron Man?

Gabie drives a Mini Cooper. She also works part time as a delivery girl at Pete’s Pizza. One night, Kayla—another delivery girl—goes missing. To her horror, Gabie learns that the supposed kidnapper had asked if the girl in the Mini Cooper was working that night. Gabie can’t move beyond the fact that Kayla’s fate was really meant for her, and she becomes obsessed with finding Kayla. She teams up with Drew, who also works at Pete’s. Together, they set out to prove that Kayla isn’t dead—and to find her before she is.

I also hit the jackpot with my own mom. I once heard that the most important thing a parent can do is to listen, just listen, to their children without offering advice or making judgements. That is my mom. I remember when she would come home from work and I would just yak away about what I learned that day, what happened, and how I felt about it. She listened to it all. (I’m pretty sure there were times when she wished I would just be quiet.) As a kid I didn’t feel like I fit in with the rest of the crowd and always felt odd, so her just listening to me made me feel that there was somewhere I belonged. I remember we would hang out with another family, and that mom would just yell at her children all of the time. Everything warranted a yell from her, and every time we left, I thanked my mom for not being her.
The pantry-our should I say pantries (we have 3). All serve a different purpose. First up, what I like to call the "staples pantry". This is where we store canned goods, dry goods such as rice and noodles, sauces, extra items (such as ketchup, mustard, steak sauce), cooking spices/rubs, and of course, Kylee has her place at the bottom for her food and other essentials. I try to keep this pantry well stocked with items that I can create easy meals with, even in a pinch. I hate preparing dinner only to find I am missing something and have to run to the store!

How do we feel about these two cases? I suspect we’d feel that Mike from Case D should be exempt from liability: his idle fantasies are exactly the kind of thing we want to protect from government intervention in a liberal society. But how about Mike from Case C? What he did was clearly less culpable than what he did in case B, but we might still feel like some intervention, or minimal form of liability is merited. Indeed, the criminal law can allow for some liability through the offence of conspiracy. However, by allowing for this we’ve definitely begun to slide from pure liberalism. That might be a perfectly acceptable thing to do — a capacity for nuance and an appreciation for the moral complexity of the real world are qualities we might like the criminal justice system to exemplify — but we have to consider where the boundaries should be drawn, if at all.

It seems disrespectful to describe him that way, but I have exactly that “highly skeptical” feeling that Mike Tymn was talking about. I’ve never gotten used to the idea of talking directly with Jesus, especially given my severe allergy to organized religion, and I still feel embarrassed and uncomfortable bringing it up here. Yet, I must say that these contacts have been absolutely wonderful, and in the midst of them, I felt completely willing to throw myself into the experience. I can’t say precisely that I was willing to believe, but I was willing to be open and to listen and learn.
I give movie a full-blooded recommendation. I was swept away, and I enjoyed it mightily. But it was not the best superhero movie by any means. I might even go so far to say that last summer's Captain America hit more of my fanboy buttons in that regard, and none of the Marvel flicks has yet to hold a candle to Christopher Reeve and his Man of Steel. That's the gold standard still.
First of all, a Druid does not strike me a a Drow-type character at all. Drow live underground, and have no connection to nature. Instead, the Drow worship their Spider Queen, Lloth, in a matriarchal society run by Lloth’s Drow Priestesses. Similarly, though the Night Elves are historically patriarchal, the Priestesses of Elune (their Moon Goddess) tend to have a high influence, especially now that High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind is their main racial leader. Yes, Malfurion Stormrage, Arch-Druid and leader of the second most powerful group in Night Elven society, has finally returned to her side, but it is fairly obvious he leaves a lot to her…

40. The title of the film Streets of Fire starring Michael Paré and Diane Lane, was drawn from a Bruce Springsteen song, from his album Darkness on the Edge of Town. The song, unfortunately, does not appear in the film.
For a moment the bird dipped a few feet. It flapped its enormous wings furiously forcing itself to rise again. Suddenly, a blur shot out from the other side of the nest and landed on its feathery back. A set of razor sharp fangs drilled deeply into bird’s neck. The bird’s wings thrashed wildly, talons gripping the load tightly. The cat that had landed on top of it clung tightly to its back making it difficult to flap, the teeth that were sunk deep into bird’s throat crushing the windpipe made it difficult to breathe, and still, the bird would not let go of its load.

Amanda Lepore is an American model, nightlife and fashion icon, performance artist, recording artist and transgender public figure. She has appeared in advertising for numerous companies, including M.A.C. Cosmetics, Mego Jeans, The Blonds, Swatch, CAMP Cosmetics, and Heatherette, which has used her likeness on clothing as well as hiring her as a model. Lepore is also noted as a regular subject in photographer David LaChapelle’s work, serving as his muse, as well as many other photographers including Marco Ovando and Terry Richardson. She participated in his Artists and Prostitutes 1985-2005 exhibit in New York, where she “lived” in a voyeuristic life-sized set. Amanda Lepore has also released several singles, many written by and/or recorded with Cazwell. In 2011 she released her full-length debut album “I…Amanda Lepore” on Peace Bisquit.

I’ve really enjoyed Exopol and want to go to as many events as I can on this subject. I find the whole concept of the possibility of UFO Disclosure intoxicating! But I wonder if it’s really possible, as I say in the film. I decided to make a satirical film of a Presidential Disclosure speech: http://hpanwo-tv.blogspot.com/2011/08/disclosure-is-here-president-admits.html . This film illustrates the magnitude of the political explosion that Disclosure would cause. I’ve also taken the quite controversial step of wearing blackface make-up. However I despise political correctness! If I were impersonating Barry Manilow I’d wear a false noise; if I were impersonating Ronnie Corbett I’d sit on a low stool to make myself look shorter; if I were impersonating Esther Rantzen I’d wear fake teeth… so when I impersonate a black man why not wear blackface? The hypersensitive aversion some people have about this issue baffles me. The US President, at the time of writing, happens to be Barack Obama, this is the only reason I wore this make-up; what other colour was I supposed to be?

A timely reminder that even when you disagree, even strongly, on some issues there can be areas of common ground to work together. Anyway, this is a welcome step in the right direction.
Even when the questions have been raised directly at hustings meetings Livingstone has been cautious and circumspect. Given Livingstone’s admirable record in office his relative silence on the campaign trail has been unforgivable, and he has been shown up by contrast to Paddick’s willingness to address these issues.

Needless to say, I am flattered at her words and also the other goodbyes I got today at the hospital, hugs and a kiss from my psychiatrist, a hand shake from my social worker (that was very formal) and all the rest of it. Even my two American roommates made me a party in the cafeteria there, but unfortunately, I was leaving earlier than expected so we didn’t have a chance to sit down and have a nice chat before I left. They just gave me a bag of goodies like chocolate and some Pepsi!
Maybe I am single, maybe I am lonely, maybe I am “differently healthy”. But this is as it should be/is at this moment. Tomorrow I may have a different amount of company and a different level of health, a different appearance, a different age, a different social status – w.r.t. humans and dEvAs. And that is as it should be/is then.

Took a break when my uncle came by to visit. Took another break when it was time for dinner. Frozen TV dinner heated by microwave. Tasted like one can expect from such a dish. Not much but at least it was warm. Also had one half of an avocado. That was more to my taste.
Next we headed to Roman's pretesting appt for surgery this Thursday...about 10 other people in the waiting room including a woman who was on her phone swearing and dropping the "N" word non-stop so I had to take the children (both have echolailia) over near the entrance (farthest away we could get) by this point we had been in the waiting room for over 25mins and they were off the wall, running, climbing, yelling...I had to hold Roman between my legs and hold Bella who was not having it..this ensued the hitting, head butting, hair pulling, scratching & yelling...she whacked me so hard at one point my face stung for a half hour! All the while people in the waiting room are just staring at us. After 20 more mins they finally got us in a room & did Roman's exam where he was in sensory overload that he was bouncing against the exam table, flopping around....thank God the nurses & Dr realized they NEEDED to get out of there and were fast!

John Turturro, with his black suit, goatee and sunglasses, plays a nicer, more neurotic version of Phil Spector, the legendary record producer and pioneer of the Wall of Sound production technique, mixed with Don Kirshner, a rock producer who gave Neil Diamond and Carole King their starts. Of all the men that pass in and out of Denise’s life, he is a consistent presence and the voice of reason, constantly reminding her about her considerable talent while never candy-coating his opinions on her music or her life. He plays a flashy personality and one of the film’s pleasures is watching how he plays off of Douglas. There is a wonderful scene between them where Denise apologizes for her first single leading to Joel’s financial ruin but he dismisses that notion, reminding her that she wrote his first hit and many after as well as inspiring him to take chances he would have never done otherwise. It a touching moment between the two characters – one in which we see Joel let his guard down for moment and in doing so it reveals a lot about him. It is so rare that Turturro plays nice, decent guys and so it is a real treat to see him refreshingly cast against type in this film.
Me: Ah, reach around. If you make a fee-fee you don't have to give a reach around.
I made the move to pick up Rafael Soriano in the off-chance that he gets the closer title over David Robertson (who is the favorite to win the job after Rivera’s knee injury). I dropped Scott Downs thinking that he will probably give the job back to Jordan Walden at some point and that the Angels are struggling right now (when not playing the Twins). I figure I can probably find a guy similar to Downs if I need to (Capps is still on the market) or I can stream a pitcher or pick up a position player.

If you eject a live round with force, while the objection port is obstructed, you are covering it with your hand etc... (for example, trying to catch the ejected round in your hand); the round can rebound off your hand, and end up in a position where it can be set off by the ejector.
The unbelievers of the world have no access to divine insight. Oh, they may pray, calling upon God but who is their god? Who is the god of this world? Who is the god of the unbeliever? Jesus Christ gave the answer in John 8:44. “Ye are of your father, the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.”
And because I am a scotch snob, the fuller review follows with such vividly hysteria-driving description only because I know that it will be a good payback for the jabs I get from a few particular friends…who by the way, I love, adore, admire, and hold in high regard.

As I see it, the best things schools can do for kids is to help them learn how to distinguish useful talk from bullshit. I will ask only that you agree that every day in almost every way people are exposed to more bullshit than it is healthy for them to endure, and that if we can help them to recognize this fact, they might turn away from it and toward language that might do them some earthly good.

Ranadivé’s company created the TopCom version specifically for the World Economic Forum, the organization founded in 1971 by the German economist Klaus Schwab, which gathers together the world’s business, intellectual, and political leaders to discuss common issues. Because the organization has a hierarchy, so does TopCom: The top two hundred WEF members — basically, the people who run the world — can speak to one another on a given subject, and then they can choose to loop in members from lower tiers (experts, academics, etc.) as needed, widening the pool of knowledge on whatever problem is on the table.

I mention all of this because, for me, the 1981 compilation module G1-2-3, Against the Giants, encapsulates a lot of the weirdness of my early days in the hobby. I never owned any of the pastel-covered modules on which this one is based, but they were still kicking around hobby and bookstores. Indeed, I did own some pastel-covered modules, since I bought them in 1980 before they were redone. So, my friends and I had a mishmash of stuff published from before we started playing, as well as contemporary stuff published later. There's more to the weirdness than that, though. For the most part, we played RPGs amongst ourselves, but, every so often, a friend's father and older brother would run stuff for us. Even more rarely, the older brother and his friends would run us through a module. Such was the case with Against the Giants.

Now, I’m part rebel, part goodie-goodie, so I tried half a pot in line with their suggestion and half a good deal longer, on the basis that I like my cuppa to be good and strong. And you know what? They were right! 4 minutes made a perfectly good, strong cup of Assam and the 6-7 minutes brew just wasn’t the same. Up to you, guys, but you may want to keep an eye on those sands of time if you go to Tea Cup for your cuppa.

When you’re a lady-gay or a lesbo, even in a major city, there is a very small pool to pick from. After a few years, you kind of know who everyone is. So, unless you start dating from state to state or internationally there’s some crisscrossing of lovers. I call it the lesbian-lazy-susan.

What this translates as, is many of the things that you imagine would be annoying, or are with others children, such as changing a diaper (nappy in the UK), or getting drooled on, are no big deal. A diaper can be messy (and at various stages I’ve had some bad ones), but sort it out and five or ten minutes later, it is mostly forgotten about.

Before you were born all of my friends with boys would tell me there is something special about a little boy and I have to agree! I love you and your sister equally but the way you respond only to me and how sweetly you snuggle with me just makes me feel like I am your girl. :) Let's keep it that way till you are at least 16, ok? I know you will grow up to be such a gentleman and will steal some girl's heart like you have stolen mine. Your daddy and I promise to love you unconditionally and to raise you to the very best of our ability.We love you precious Connor!!
Snow is in trouble as the agent in charge Langral (Peter Stormare) is unsympathetic and believes him to be guilty. However, an old friend, Shaw (Lennie James) is slightly more helpful.
it took a little practice at first, not trying to soothe bonzo out of a crying jag or not trying to create a world for him where he wouldn't have to have upsets that would result in tears, but it felt really right knowing that crying was bonzo healing, offloading and working through big feelings and that it shouldn't be confused with suffering.

A different movie-based joyride is the Pirates of the Caribbean (also in Adventureland). There is no minimum height or age requirement for this one, yet still they managed to create an ambiance that pleases small children as well as adults at the same time. It is a fairly relaxing boat ride, with small drops, but hearing the skulls talk to you and some pirates singing and drinking rum is worth every bit of your time.

"The syrup colors the head as well as the beer, the woodruff making for a vivid lime-cordial hue and the raspberry looking more like peach. Everyone knows the flavor of raspberry, but what about the essence of woodruff? Sampled on its own, it is heavily fragrant, with notes of hay, lemon grass, and cough drops. The herb grows in the forests around Berlin, and is also used to make a soft drink and to flavor mineral water. When Berliner Weisse is served in this way, the idea is that the drinker first tastes the sweetness of the syrup, then sense the acidity of the beer.

For my wedding cake card I used some new stunning paper from Teresa Collins. I just picked this up last week and couldn't wait to use it! I like the blue and yellow color combo for a wedding...so summery! I simply stamped the lovely cake image on white cardstock and colored with Copics. The sentiment is stamped on a paper ribbon and I added a big 'ol frame of pearls to showcase that pretty dragonfly paper and image. I also added a little sparkle to each of the flowers with Stickles.

You do not need to precook the chicken. It will cook as it boils in the canner. I put 1 tsp of chicken bouillon in the bottom of each jar. This is not necessary but I was interested in having really good broth for chicken soup. I cut all the fat off my boneless, skinless thighs, and then put them into the jars. There is no need to add any liquid. You should not pack them down tightly but they cook down quite a bit during the canning process. Next time I will put more in than I did this time. Make sure that you leave an inch of head room though.

You see, for any of the above to matter, the left would have to have some shred of virtue. And they simply don’t have any virtue at all. They are liars without honesty, shame or integrity.

Now today- Today was a good day. This morning I went to the park and walked by myself. The sort of thing I have hesitated to do because of the hide and seek quality of my equilibrium; one moment I am fine, the next I can feel like I am on a boat- or like I am falling through the ground, or feel like I am being pushed down, or falling backward. Every day I get to ask myself will I be okay today? Answer-Heck I don't know. But today walking I didn't have any problems, and so fueled by that success, I was inspired to try rollerblading this afternoon. I have wanted to do it for the past month but have been scared to try. I mean in the past months I have almost fallen while standing perfectly still on flat ground, so it didn't seem like the best sort of idea. But I did it, and I was fine. Like with walking, moving faster and more decisively tends to work best, much better than attempting lots of stops and starts, looking around, and turning in circles. And hours later I still feel fine. I know I could still get walloped, it has happened before- where I think something went well, but there is just a time-lapse till the consequence arrives. But so far I'm feeling cheerful. Excited by the prospect that this is an activity I can still do and enjoy.
Murder is an external sin. It is obvious and visible. It is easy to condemn the murderer. But Jesus tells us to take care less we even have a seething anger against another. Our anger can be visible or invisible. It matters not; we have the seeds of murder in our heart, and we had best uproot them by the Father’s grace. And so Jesus teaches about a life lived and judged by attitudes in the heart. There is nothing here by which we can judge others. We can only take His words, and by the illumination of the Holy Spirit, judge our own lives and move to change.

﻿Having seen so much of the changes that have occurred in the last couple of years, and especially just recently, I thought I would give you some heads up on why the Mortgage Underwriter and Processor keep asking for more documentation. It seems like a mountain of information that is needed to get a loan to approval these days and we all know why. Let me remind you, yet again, though it seems excessive, it is necessary to fully implement due diligence and determine whether someone really does qualify for a loan. The underwriter usually gets blamed for declining a loan, regardless of what the issues are and just recently something was written online about Real Estate Agencies requesting less strict underwriting guidelines. After all we have been through as a Nation, let alone the many homeowners who could face never owning another home, how could anyone request something like this?

Ms Wong claims that she never actually downloaded the film, did not tell anyone else to download it, and did not know anyone was using her internet service to download the video. She also argues that the settlement letter sent to her was designed to coerce her into settling the case despite the absence of any facts supporting liability against her.
With a handclasp and a bear hug to Hermel, and a nod and wave to everyone else, Hormel turned and headed off northward along the road though the undulating sea of white drift snow. The other members of the party turned and went south. They walked for a few hours until they came to the area of hills where the Prancing Unicorn Inn was located. After a while they stopped. From the other side of a hill they saw a plume of smoke rising into the sky.

Another important act that performed out here in the early days was an Irishman named Pat Rooney. The Irish dominated the variety scene in the early decades…there were hundreds of performers who did a Hibernian act and Pat Rooney would be way at the top of the list of the most famous and beloved. As we saw with Weber and Fields, ethnic groups were generally reduced to humorous stereotypes. To us, Pat Rooney’s outfit would look like a leprechaun costume, although he was credited with giving one of the more nuanced and human portrayals of his day. Picture knee breeches and shoes with big buckles and a big checked coat and a dented plug hat, and glued on red whiskers, and a big, flowing bow tie of the old fashioned sort that actually looks like a bow. Rooney would clog dance, and sing humorous and sentimental songs like “Owen Riley” and “The Sound Democrat”. He passed away in the 1890s but he was the father of a whole dynasty of Pat Rooneys. His son Pat Rooney, Jr. was even more famous than he was and was a big star in the hey day of vaudeville, and Pat Rooney III was performing as late as the 1960s.

So the fact that Tripel Karmeliet's nose first brought to mind bologna for me isn't as disgusting as it might sound; I immediately wanted to call the beer "Best Bologna Beer." Then a sip brought a wallop of bready notes, not unlike you'd get from a good lager. After this the character changed with each sip.

As we paged through the book together–which is very well done, I have to say–I found myself looking for information about an unknown, yet significant casualty of the terrible events of April, 1912. Finding none, I decided to take matters into my own hands in this space. If you’ve ever heard of Homer C. Davenport before, please accept my apologies. But if not, please read on. You might learn something worthwhile if you do.
Earlier this year I had the thrill of catching one of Prince’s concerts at the Los Angeles Forum. It was the last of the string of concerts he played there, one of 21 I believe. Or was it 68? For all I know he’s still there playing, jumping around on his platforms and two replaced hips. Whatever, it was an amazing night, a truly kick-ass, loud, crazy, hysterical night where we partied like it was 1999.

In the beginning, the hardest part was getting over the jet lag. They say it takes one day per every hour in the time difference – and they were right. (South Korea is 14-15 hours ahead of Chicago, by the way.) Despite being awake at odd hours it felt almost too easy to get back into a few old routines. Some were nice, like driving to the mall while listening to the radio or spending a weekend with my family. Other habits needed to be restricted, like eating CHEESE for every meal and watching reality TV. I wouldn’t want to further enforce the typical “American” stereotype I’ve fought against for the past 3.5 years.

However, John Gribbin piles on the conceptual anguish as he theorises that our universe may be just one of many, numbering much more than a mere 1,000 billion. The figure he comes up with is an estimated 1 with 500 noughts after it.
It’s hard to describe the style of writing. Because of the casualness of the way the story ebbs and flows, it doesn’t feel like a novel. It is more a voyeuristic read through someone’s diary, which I found really refreshing.

Due to my current massive Sweet Valley High obsession and the discovery that almost every Dublin library copy of anything to do with The Glorious Wakefields was either worn out at some point in the nineties or checked out and NEVER RETURNED (shame on you, Dublin pre-teens from the nineties) I've taken to scouring charity shops for second hand Sweet Valley wonderfulness.

Ok…. So I kept reading on all the blogs that the register rewards associated with the U by Kotex was still rolling. I have been really hesitant to try this after the Pepsi Next register rewards didn’t roll like the blogs were saying. Some people were blogging that it was probably working by region or by states. I wasn’t too willing to risk losing my register reward if it didn’t roll, like the Pepsi Next didn’t. But, of course, it is always in the back of your mind. So, I did it. I bit the bullet and gave it a try. IT WORKED! I rolled one register reward 20 times total at 3 stores. Each time, the new $3 register reward printed! I added a caramel to each transaction and paid .32 cents plus tax! WHAT A DEAL!
The agreement, broadly understood, codifies the ongoing conditions under which the US government agrees to operate in Afghanistan and will guide policies on the management of military bases, authority over detainees, the execution of night raids and other security operations, and will set conditions for troop levels and residual US forces that will remain in Afghanistan even after a ‘withdrawal’ commences in 2014. The agreement also deals with ongoing financial support for the Afghan government and military into the future.

This bill, known as SOPA for short in the U.S., is rooted in the now 13 year-old battle being waged by the "content industry," Hollywood and the record labels in particular, to curb the infringement of copyright online. SOPA focuses on preventing U.S. citizens from accessing “foreign infringing sites” and downloading copyrighted content coming from overseas (There is also support from the pharmaceutical and medical industries, as the bill is also meant to curb the sale of counterfeit drugs from foreign countries to American patients). The bill was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives late last year. (A similar bill is in the U.S. Senate known as the Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA) - we shall discuss it later as it moves more to the forefront).

There's no bullshit or pretentions with cummings - he is always tenderly honest, however ugly or uncomfortable the topic. Most amazingly, he makes everything his pen touches, absolutely beautiful. He sees things (and all such imperfections) in a different light, and writes about them so affectionately (without that superficial gloss and veneer) that they are revealed to be actually quite stunning... Maybe I'm being absolutely nonsensical right now, but cummings just has this profound effect on me.

reading, and owners of tablets and e-book readers particularly stand out as reading more now. Some 41% of tablet owners and 35% of e-reading device owners said they are reading more since the advent of e-content. Fully 42% of readers of e-books said they are reading more now that long-form reading material is available in digital format. The longer people have owned an e-book reader or tablet, the more likely they are to say they are reading more: 41% of those who have owned either device for more than a year say they are reading more vs. 35% of those who have owned either device for less than six months who say they are reading more.

My main criticisms are that it often doesn’t make enough of the space it has, insisting on leaving sections blank (like ‘working titles) when there is no information for pre allotted sections rather than expanding others to provide some extra info; and most infuriating of course, the lack of an alphabetical index, which in a guide like this is crucial one would have though! Definitely loses a star just for that I’m afraid.

We will check into the Relais St Germain Hotel early afternoon and once we have settled in and perhaps taken a walk over to Pierre Hermé for a macaron, we will meet Francois at 6 pm to have a drink at the Bonaparte. Francois will explain about the restaurant scene in Paris, what has changed, which are the improvements and what has been lost. We will return to the hotel at 8 pm to have dinner at Le Comptoir with a menu devised by Francois and Guy de Camdeborde who we will meet if he is not travelling. If we are still feeling energetic after dinner, we may go to a nearby bar for a nightcap or perhaps just walk in St Germain des Prés.
I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; he descended into hell; on the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.

Baptism was not some new thing that John the Baptist started. For most purification ceremonies, immersion into a mikvah was a standard ritual prescribed by Torah. We just finished studying the Torah portion Metzora, which describes the purification rituals for cleansing a leper and a leperous home. Before a cleansed leper could return to a state of ritual purity (levitically speaking) he would need be immersed in a mikvah, or in other words, get baptized. (Leviticus 14:9)
Indeed, Khmer architecture features nature lovingly interacting with it. The complexity of the layout of Ta Prohm is enhanced by its partly collapsed state, with trees interlaced among the ruins. This was the temple chosen to be left in its natural state to show how most of the Angkor temples looked upon its discovery during the 19th century. The tree shall then becomes a support for the temple, but when it dies, or is felled by a storm, the loosened blocks of the temple shall eventually collapse as well.

If I like it I will gladly discover more material about it or even watch the movie a second time without having to semi-watch it every time I watch TV. What I really don’t need is a teaser for a teaser for a trailer which really come to think of it is an announcement for an announcement for an announcement announcing a movie….that sounds pretty stupid to me!

But, unless, or until you act, I possess none of those things. I am simply empty, so I mutely stare back at you and plead for your mercy.

Stress causes an increase in a hormone called cortisol that can cause obesity. People’s bodies, those who experience high levels of work related stress, release cortisol in response to the ‘flight or fight’ factors found in the brain. Cortisol causes excess belly fat. A study done on the difference between regular shift workers and irregular shift truck drivers shows a marked increase in cortisol production for irregular shift truck drivers.

Twenty-four hours later and Senna accelerated away but Prost got the better start and took the lead. Senna looked for a gap on the inside of the first corner that disappeared quickly. Contact was inevitable and the McLaren and Ferrari disappeared into a cloud of dust. The outcome of the 1990 FIA Formula One World Championship had been decided in a matter of seconds in such sad and distasteful circumstances. It was a second title for Senna but bittersweet. Only at the same event a year later, with Balestre gone and replaced by Max Mosley did Senna admit that he deliberately ran Prost off the road in 1990. His will and desire to win couldn’t be faulted but in attempting to knock another car out on purpose was a hideous crime, which on a normal UK road would land you with at least a driving ban and possibly a jail sentence.

Abraham Alreser Schoenberg (Al Shean, b. 1868) had been a messenger, pants presser, and butcher boy before forming the Manhattan Quartette in 1888 with Charley Harris, George Brennan and Sam Curtis. The team played Bowery music halls and had at least one engagement at at Tony Pastor’s 14th Street. After a few years of this, he found some legit work. In 1891 he was cast in Apple Orchard Farm, at the Windsor Theatre, which closed after two weeks. His next show The County Fair gave him a run of three years. From 1895-1900 he was in the Manhattan Comedy Four with Sam Curtis, Arthur Williams and Ed Mack of Harrigan and Hart’s old troup. The group sang songs like “Sweet Molly Moran” and “After the Ball” in four part harmony and did comedy sketches, many of them written by Shean. The team was big time and toured the country, but Shean left to from a partnership with Charles L. Warner, with whom he performed through 1904.
He turned out quite cute, if I do say so myself. I hung him haphazardly in the living room, in August, to see how he looked. Santa looked like it was too hot outside to have him on the wall. Now he is hanging comfortably in a closet... for another month or two. It felt great to get that quilt finished.

She walks forward, more on impulse that anything else, her defense mechanisms seemingly silenced. Defenses. She looks down at her own bare skin and notes that she is no longer covered in sores or seeping pores. She is still naked, but no longer feels the slight chill that even her Manusan physiognomy was finding uncomfortable. Interestingly, her own skin has a reddish tinge in this light, and she wonders if the woman truly is red herself, or if it’s just a trick of the light.

The difference is that currently it is a completely different ball-game altogether.

Put the sugarcube on a paper napkin or bit of kitchen roll before dropping the Bitters onto it - I find that if you lob the sugar in the glass first, it's all too easy to end up with a great, overpowering lug of Angostura. Drop it into a champagne flute and add 2 teaspoons of Remy Martin and one of Grand Marnier. Top up with Laurent Perrier (Claridges house champagne), and then pare a slice of orange peel over the glass so the oil adds a tiny hint of citrus.

For 50% of comparisons, gay and lesbian partners did not differ from heterosexual partners. Seventy-eight percent of comparisons on which differences were found indicated that gay or lesbian partners functioned better than heterosexual partners did. Because the variables that predicted concurrent relationship quality and relationship stability for heterosexual parents also did so for gay and lesbian partners, I conclude that the processes that regulate relationships functioning generalize across gay, lesbian, and heterosexual couples” (Kurdek).

Israeli is destined to die, the only question is when. Only a fascist hyena, or an ignoramus like Clegg, would confuse the people of Israel for the state. The state is a racist, apartheid state. It is destined for the funeral pyre and one can only hope that day comes soon. But like South Africa, the people we hope will devise new structures with which to live in peace and equality.
I don’t want to go into great detail about the plot but this particular books focuses on the trouble faced by those at the Institute for what is seen as their error in the whole ‘Mortmain’ affair and his subsequent disappearance – and more importantly the lack of confidence that the other Shadowhunters/Clave now have in Charlotte’s ability to continue running the Institute – as such she is given an ultimatum which if she doesn’t fulfill will have severe consequences.
There are lots of rumours going around about who might put their name forward at this year's election, but we will all have to wait and see who is officially confirmed by the electoral officer. Doug Cuthand, a columnist for the Star Phoenix talks about a couple of these potential candidates:
I'm sure many of you have heard of Bath and Body Works, and probably are as obsessed with their candles as I am. But, this weekend they had a sale going on for 2 of their 3 wick candles (the big ones) for $20. They're usually $19.50 each, so it's basically 2 for the price of 1, which is amazing! They also had their little mini candles for 2/$5, so of course I picked some of those up to include in a giveaway I have planned for if I get to 300 followers! :)
And she's really nice!
I mean, honestly...how redic are they? I am a lucky gal, I tell ya.
Right? Hope so. I'm already looking forward to the next project.

10. Moving
In all honesty, Jack has been a pain in his recuperation. I do realize that I have hardly any sympathy or empathy with those who have a low pain threshold. He refuses to take his medicine, which should be fine if he's the only one suffering. However, he's making everyone around him suffer with his crabbiness and misbehavior. I am ready for him to be well. Hopefully 12 hours of sleep will bring him to rights again.
I grew up in a house turned preschool since my mom’s a teacher and she wanted to build her own school. This school has expanded into something bigger so our family had to move out and leave everything else behind. The preschool on the ground floor remains while our 2nd floor (where my room used to be) is being used as storage room. This saddens me as I have so many memories from that place.
I was thrilled to discover how quick and easy it is to make homemade cocoa mix. It offers the ease and convenience of the store bought packets, but tastes much better. After much trial and error, here is the recipe that I came up with. Enjoy!

Not only that, but I figured if I somehow threw myself into early labor whilst listening to Diane Rehm, well, then that would be a bonus.
Another thing I'm really excited about is the release of the much anticipated Mother of Pearl book which is due to release in the next couple of months.
The climb continued up through Lady Canning's Plantation and I finally began to find a bit of form. Once out onto the moorland it's a short additional climb to the Oxstones which mark the highest point of the race at about four miles in. Then the final two miles start with a quick and easy descent across the moor, straight through the Houndkirk Bridleway, and then a steeper and very rocky descent down to Sheephill Road which suits my style. I always seem to gain ground and places in these situations, and so it was on Wednesday as I reeled in a couple of guys in front of me and passed them.

It comes so easily to you to show honor to God, but not so easily when it comes to honoring yourself. Why is that? Your soul began as a spark of God. You are created in God’s image. To hold yourself in this accord is to honor God on the highest level.

It’s a quiet evening at home; Beulah is sleeping on my lap and I’m watching old episodes of “Frasier” (strangely comforting) and resting my tired legs after a hard hour of running earlier. I love this feeling; both of us tired, both of us quiet, candlelight and blankets. The weeks of this fresh new year are flying by and soon January will be over and done. I feel like every time I look up it’s the weekend again – and no complaints there!

Nikki longs to spend these months reconnecting with her boyfriend, Jack, the one person she loves more than anything. But there's a problem: Cole, the smoldering immortal who first enticed her to the Everneath, has followed Nikki to the mortal world. And he'll do whatever it takes to bring her back- this time as his queen.
I got word today that my second in the Mickey Rangel detective series, tentatively titled The Lemon Tree Caper. This is very cool news. I had a ton of fun writing this one, getting Mickey on the case for a second time. Now to get to work on the next.
Which means that it is the Electoral College is almost all that matters now. I say almost because turnout is also an important factor in swing states, and national polls can effect turnout. They can also help influence fundraising (You don’t put up money for a complete loser if there is no hope whatsoever). But the reality is that this is more or less all up to the Electoral College.

In the final episode of the 1994 X-Men cartoon series, Xavier is incapacitated by an assassination attempt. Wolverine, Cyclops and Jean Grey go to his mutant island of Genosha and try to plead for his help. After a small skirmish, and hearing the facts he concedes knowing full well that Xavier would do anything to help him. In an episode of the cartoon Wolverine and the X-Men, when a comatose Xavier washes up on the shores of Genosha he takes him in and cares for him as a guest and offers to let him and the other X-Men stay. They decline his offer and he lets them leave, with his blessing. In the movie X:Men: The Last Stand, Magneto appears just as upset over Xavier’s death as Wolverine and Storm. Then when a mutant punk named Pyro tells him he would have killed Xavier had Magneto given the order, Magneto shuts him down, saying, in all sincerity “Charles Xavier did more for mutant kind then you’ll ever know.”
Thanks for inviting me to guest here at Terry’s Place! I’m delighted to stop by, especially as today is Beltane, or May Day, which I’ve decided is a rather auspicious release date for my first paranormal cozy mystery.
Vincent LaForet was the first to popularise the 5DmkII with his film, “Reverie.” After Reverie hit the internet a wave of young, old and new filmmakers rushed out to pick up the new camera. As LaForet recently mentioned during an interview panel at Sundance with Rob Legato, Jacob Rosenberg and Sharlto Copley, “…someone once said I was the best thing to happen to Canon and the worst thing to happen to Canon….” (watch the full interview here)

I'm definitely not complaining about Eric being here, it was just hard to focus without my usual routine. On one morning, when Eric went in to receive some orders & get some office work done, I found myself completely scattered. I went to go get dressed and decided I wanted to do this facial scrub I read about on pinterest. Then I went to go get dressed again and decided that I needed to hand wash my bras. Later that day I went to go put the clean dishes away. Thirty minutes later the clean dishes were still in the dish rack, but my pantry had been reorganized & all the expired products thrown out.

The very top of the range TVs are in a different league. They contain a lot of features that the lower range models don’t. They also contain a lot of new technology, things that aren’t standard production technology yet, which may not be part of standard TV equipment for years. A big Sony LED/LCD TV, for example, has a range of features you just won’t see on the lower ranges.
Premium Times had continuously reported that Abul Qaqa was not arrested contrary to reports and that it was Abu Darda, another member, that was arrested.
These are just some of the best practices that I would like to share to help you address your people retention and employee attrition challenges and to evade the dangers of “brain drain” or “intellectuals’ loss”. Hopefully, with these being put to practice, you would be able to make more loyal, more committed, more dedicated, more motivated, and more satisfied employees in your team members and that they wouldn’t be admonished to turn in their resignation letters and look for greener pastures somewhere else; somewhere else that knows how to take good care of their employees better.

~~The illusionist (formerly mi vampiro. i don't know why i didn't think of that name sooner. he is always just disappearing on me and like a bad illusionist he sometimes doesn't reappear until the next week when you see him strolling down the street.) and i are havin a wee issue. a couple of weeks before i left belize, he stopped staying the night at my house. because he thought there was a malicious spirit there. I told him that was no spirit, that was me curled up next to him whilst he was dreaming, but he is convinced it was a spirit. ok, i don't believe that, but he does. Fine. The problem is, he stopped inviting me to his house. What? Too much for him to stay there, but it's ok for me? 'I love you, go play with the spirit. Don't get possessed. I am going to have to practice my Linda Blair impersonation.
I'm a control freak (to be completely honest with you)... but not in the way where I have to take charge, boss people around, and do things my way... different from that.
I had a video Skype session with Ram Dass a few years ago, a service called a “Heart-to-Heart” that he makes available to his website subscribers. My agenda in setting up the conversation was to ask him for his blessing before I set out on a book tour to promote a memoir that featured my history with him in the first and last chapters, symmetrically framing the whole work. And though I had badgered him repeatedly the previous year, in the end he had opted not to endorse the back of my book. So now, if I couldn’t get his blurb, I felt I at least needed his blessing. He paused a moment when I asked, closed his eyes to search for his answer, then looking straight into the camera and pointing his finger, said very calmly, “You have my blessing, as long as you tell the truth.”
On Sunday, Mrs Yogic and I went to see Misterman by Irish playwright Enda Walsh at the National Theatre. Performed by just one man in the cavernous space of the Lyttleton, this is the most sublimely affecting theatre I’ve seen in years. Cillian Murphy is an astonishing actor and the star of two of my favourite films of the last fifteen years: Disco Pigs and 28 Days Later. He is at his best in this brilliant play about faith, imagination and memory set in smalltown Ireland.
For me those three letters represent struggle; pain; misunderstanding; confusion; loss; rejection; and the most overwhelming love I have ever known.

It’s important to consider what you can offer to the student to help them grow and develop within your working environment. Ensuring that you have the time and facilities to provide suitable training is important and training courses can provide great incentive for placement applicants if the company are not able to offer much in the way of financial payment. The university are available throughout the year to provide assistance and advice if required, and each student is allocated an academic supervisor.
Today I'm inside with poor Jack who was attacked by the nasty stomach bug last night. Oh well, tho it's sunny out it's also COLD so I'll putz at my Easter decor and maybe post some pics of that soon.

Blabber went running about with her "it's a rare disease" shout while Glory Dear stuffed Miss Priss and I with food and The Blue Guy started starring at the rest of the brood. Blabber's pet tarsier tried to help but even he was scared of your hypochondriac yelp. Irish Air was trying to speak but it seems we were all up the creek. For no one could talk or even walk until his eyes were through with their slot machine view. He looked toward Irish Air and you can tell she wanted to chop off that eejit's pair. In his gaze came a blaze and things got dire. For Irish Air sported a head of fire. She rain to Petsy's fountain to put it out but then began to shout. For the fountain had been turned to liquor and her head burned quicker.

Sorry I don't have any crafter's eye candy to share with you today. I haven't made anything for several days now (must be due for withdrawl to set in!). I have been busy with family over the Easter holiday, and I am busy making a Snorepro device for my brother who is visiting from the USA. Imagine how surprised I was to discover that he and I have virtually identical teeth! Who would have thought.... I guess that confirms we are siblings, so that's a good thing!

racial equality and that was a good thing
The thought has been on both of our minds as we've slowly erased the evidence of previous tenants in that once cave-like space. The dark, dreary blue that covered the walls when we moved in was also swiped on the ceiling, smeared on the door frames and baseboards, even spattered on the window -- a careless job that made for pain-in-the-ass repairs, which we'd already had to do in the other room with much trial and error. We didn't have the skills to remove the baseboards for recoating, so D resorted to using a painter's taping spatula to shove old sheets under the baseboard edges followed by pieces of corrugated cardboard, all to shield the carpet while I painted over the damage. It was maddeningly slow. But with every drop of blue we obliterated, the room felt cleaner. Lighter. More and more the nest we've wanted it to become.

I find this particularly refreshing because I grew up in Taiwan and moved to the deserts of Arizona when I was a teenager. I remember landing at the airport in Tucson and feeling the eyes of half of the terminal staring at me and my family. Eventually I got used to being the only person in my school who didn’t speak English (yet), the only Asian kid in my class, and just generally sticking out like a sore thumb. A few years later when I arrived in San Francisco to go to college, standing at the luggage terminal, I felt an odd comfort. For the first time in a long time, absolutely nobody was staring at me.

Casa Pasiflora is an old traditional house, which has been renovated to provide 2 apartments with modern facilities, but still keeping much of the original character. It is beautifully situated overlooking the banana plantation and is at the end of a quiet cul de sac, with space for parking. The attractive terraces and garden make this a haven while only being a short walk from the facilities of the village.

I confess, I journal! And I use spiral-bound paper books with a good old fashion pencil. OK, I admit I don’t have daily entries (sometimes months go-by in between my paper thoughts) and these entries are not uniform in style or address. I do however find it extremely therapeutic. (And it didn’t cost me $100 per session). My journal is the perfect place to dream, complain, to express my joy and anger, to work through the delicate intricacies of being a wife, a mother of teens and being female. To ponder, muse; delight in the things that delight me and to pose many thoughts and questions to God for help, answers and direction in life. In fact, this writing was based on a recent journal entry.

I don't really remember how I came up with Oliver's first name. I had heard a few times and realized I really loved it because it was different, not too many kids had it, but wasn't super weird. Richard is after my wonderful daddy. I am so glad that Oliver has such wonderful male examples in his life and I am glad we could name him after one of them. And I am so glad that he has a wonderful dad that is a worthy priesthood holder and an example of righteousness!
Needless to say I was quite afraid to wear them at first, especially since I was doing some electrical work this week.

One by one I managed to escape unscathed (the hidden damage from Hardee’s is still unknown.)
The CAMBRIDGE CENTRE for the study of WESTERN ESOTERICISM is independent of any academic or esoteric communities, the co-ordinators share an interest in the need for a wider dialogue between scholars and practitioners in the field of Western Esotericism and in the establishment of a secular space in which an interdisciplinary network can thrive (see people).

Inside stands the glass staircase that integrates the rooms on the second floor, in a more intimate and sheltered area outside. The visual relationship between the two levels is established through the double height volume of the room, which passes through a bridge of glass covered with a pergola that connects the rooms to the bedrooms and the master bedroom balcony, which has an outdoor terrace that projects into the landscape. This dynamic surrounding set in the beautiful countryside makes the house extremely versatile. Also, its complementing aspects of the interior with the outside of the house, and its multiple levels adds to the overall grandeur of the house.

Keen students of show business may well remember that Piers Morgan (aka his latest anagram, the Grime Parson) claims he was the man who cost Paul McCartney about £24.3 million, by introducing him to Heather Mills-Bomb. During the courtship, however, the Unibomber apparently texted to a friend, ‘I’m being pursued by a Beatle’. Thinking back, mind you, I’m not sure I recall how we knew about that text….but never mind.

You're obsessed with clocks. Oh good lord. You can spot one on a billboard, in the car, in a grocery store on a tv show, anywhere. It's your favorite word in the world to say. (I'm glad I'm not the only one in the family that is obsessed with them.) You also are in love with rocks, which makes my heart happy. You don't hesitate to run outside, barefooted, onto the gravel driveway to pick out just the right little stones. When you bring them to me, as if they were diamonds, with sparkles in your eyes, it's the world 10 times brighter in my heart. Can I tell you something? I've kept every single one you've given me. I have them all in a little jar. Yeah, I know it will overflow one day but, they are my treasures from your first adventures in life. Building towers in your specific way is a hoot to watch. You wear your thoughts on your face. Your daddy and I have all the entertainment we need just watching you figure things out, processing your thoughts or trying to tell us something.

So Sunday is my last official day of being a smoker. I have been mentally preparing myself for 2 weeks now. Telling myself I am GOING to quit, everytime I smoke I curse the cigarette out telling it that I will not use it anymore after Sunday and just preparing myself in general that I can and will do this. I am scared to death more than anything. Scared of failing but how am I going to know if I will succeed if I don't try it? Worst case like my mom said I try and fail and I just have to try again. I am just hoping and praying for the best. I know the first few days and the first week is going to be the toughest but I have been putting a plan in place.
Dimpled glass. Smells malty and has the thin musty piney hop smell of maybe Sterling, like the 2 Deg Below. Strong poofy head, darker amber color. Oh yeah. It tastes like their Pale Ale with that strong malt up front, but with a Sterling hoppish thing in the middle, but a Cascade hop aftertaste. I imagine they put the Cascade early in the boil b/c you can't smell it, but put this other hop just before fermenting or even dry hopping. The maltiness is not as existent the more I drink it, and I'm left with this Cascade aftertaste that ain't goin nowhere, as in it's 5 minutes later and I'm still tasting hops

Up until this moment, the school of those on the side of a natural phenomenon was not lacking valid arguments. This discovery considerably weakens their position and leads to a series of discoveries which confirms the artificial, “intelligent” character of the phenomenon.

A year of not trying, not stressing, not being pregnant, not breastfeeding. A year of nice times, holidays with family and just a lot less stress.

Just occasionally, I look out of my bedroom window at night and see a ferry steaming out to sea, its bright lights reflected in the inky blackness of the English Channel. Sailors have been putting to sea from Newhaven and other Sussex towns for centuries, rowing, sailing or under power; many have failed to return, due to war, weather or shipwreck. But watching these great vessels gliding silently to goodness knows where brings a sense of continuity to an ordinary event. Newhaven has seen better days, but it battles on regardless, like a tramp steamer chugging on in the teeth of a westerly gale. Long may it do so, I say.

In 9th grade the Journalism teacher came to our class "recruiting" students for the newspaper. I thought it sounded like the dumbest thing based on her presentation, so I wasn't interested. But many of my friends joined the next term. One day, a couple weeks into the new term my friend invited me down to the newspaper room so she could finish an article. I saw a room full of computers, so I sat down and started drawing on one. The teacher came out to chew me out about being on off-limits computers. Then she saw what I had drawn and "hired" me for the newspaper. Thus began my formal graphic designing.

You know how they say truth is stranger than fiction? Well, after this week, I'm starting to believe it.
In the first sentence, a bus driver is killed, shot by an unknown gunman on Auckland’s bustling Albert Street during Friday rush hour. Detective Sean Devereaux picks up the case, only to discover wildly conflicting witness accounts then a sense the victim wasn’t the true target. But then, who was? At the same time Devereaux is dealing with a double killing in the affluent suburbs: the wife and daughter of a prominent finance company director. Murder-suicide or double homicide? The police turn their attention to the husband, but Devereaux has doubts. Meanwhile, John Hale is largely unavailable to assist, as he’s witnessed a kidnapping, and finds himself the target of a dogged senior police officer as he tries to do his own private investigations.
The Hernandez sisters come in and find her. The Hernandez sisters are notorious liars and/or dreamers. There account is unreliable. Rosalita will have to tell people that again and again for the next few weeks.

So, what is the best triple ton? Sorry to disappoint you but I’ve got no idea. I’m not going to attempt to compare Clarke with Bradman or any other player who I’ve never seen. But you’ve now at least got some facts to think about when debating Clarke’s performance.
The problem is that while Ambiga heads a civil rights movement which is winning support by the day from young people, who incidentally make up the bulk of new voters, she has chosen to tie that movement with Opposition politics.
I recently found your blog through YHL and I LOVE all of your ideas! I love that you are such a DIYer, just like my husband and I. I just wanted to share my recently created blog, ourhumbleabowed.wordpress.com with you. I am very OCD about things having a place. So much so that I have a label maker and used it to identify where bedding and towels should go in our linen closet. My husband thinks I'm a little crazy for it, but he admits it's nice to have things organized. He is the total opposite from me in that regard.
So the victory is not in self-improvement, but in the opposite of it: The Son was sent into the world to die willingly, not in an attempt to dethrone the Father! When death came near, a death that would not only be his own, but a death like dying billions of deaths at once, a death for others, he was honest about his human feelings: “if it is possible, let this cup of suffering pass by”, but heart in heart with his Father “not my will, but your will be done”.

The new album When It Rains from Coventry band Silent Screams marks not only an impressive debut for the UK metalcore band but the initial release from Ghost Music, the new label founded by Ghostfest creator Toyan St Hilaire, who made the band his first signing. Immediately impressed by the band’s album St Hilaire threw himself into unleashing it on the world; commenting about the release he said “As soon as I heard the new SILENT SCREAMS record, I just knew it was gold – I just knew I had to do something with it… ‘When It Rains’ made such an impact on me that I’ve decided to finally put my money where my mouth is; hence GHOST MUSIC was born! I’m super excited to be working with this band and their record!” Upon hearing When It Rains it is easy to understand his enthusiasm as the album is a power house of intent and creation. For a debut it is immense and though it may not be flawless it carries an edge and purpose as well as thoroughly stunning sounds that many if not most releases lack.
And that would not leave a space for the Newco to apply to join the top division.

Her case has been repeatedly listed up in the Supreme Court but has been postponed every time. Throughout the duration of Soni Sori’s imprisonment, the state has also tried to stifle her communications with the civil society. In January this year, a team from various women’s groups across the country went to Raipur Jail to meet Soni, but they were prevented from doing so by the administration.

You know how you know that you are getting older? When the only time you “drop it like it’s hot” is when you are doing jump squats when working out. And the only “grinding” that you are doing is coffee beans in the morning. Ok maybe those are extreme examples, but recently a couple of my friends and I started our Sunday Cooking club as a way for us to hang out (goodbye clubbing and bar hopping days?) Each month we are going to pick a theme and each person is going to bring a dish/ingredients in. Our first theme as Asian Cuisine!

A few minutes later, we walked over to the rose arbor which was filled with climbing roses. We sat on a bench, holding hands and talking for about 15 minutes.
Boy were these bars good. Since I'm watching how much I eat lately I only had one of these but that was no problem since the rest disappeared pretty quickly. I brought some to work and they were gone by lunch time......I think these would be really good also with a peanut butter and chocolate chip combo. I found this recipe over at Katy's blog Food for a Hungry Soul. I have to say that this soul here is hungry all the time lately!!! Anyhow, if you are not familiar with Katy's blog please go over and check it out. She has so many good recipes!
Did her termination have something to do with the story about a prescription-abusing doctor, whom Sherman met on a swinger website?
I am still experiencing culture shock a year and a half later. I am often stopped where I walk. I am struck still by a brand new experience almost every day, some as tiny as a speck of glitter. But, oh, do they shine. They are made up of elements I've seen before, but each behaves in a way that I am completely unfamiliar with. It's kind of been like being on vacation for a long time (and just as expensive!), save for all the working and chores and washing your own towels stuff.

I've had a crush on Jack Black since his HBO Tenacious D days... I find him adorable and irresistable. I pride myself in my morning Tenacious D guitar riffs, playing 3 chords and making up stupid songs with Brad about cooking eggs, over easy, and who doesn't like the bacon, skit skat doodley dat... god I'm a nerd. Ok so Check out Brutal Legend, highly reccomend this game, its just good fun, and how can you not love a game that you need to build a hot rod called The Duece to get you around the play field...

How was everyone's Christmas celebration? Mine was absolutely wonderful. But that being said, it was a little strange as well. Christmas Eve was fun going to the Nutcracker (which was breathtaking as usual), and then the family came over for a dinner celebration. When everyone left however, I got that sad feeling that Greg wasn't with us. It really hurt my heart. My mom gave me PJ's as she has every Christmas Eve, and we read a book together. It was nice. The next morning, Christmas morning to be exact, it still was weird. I probably didn't act as excited with my gifts as I should've been. But sitting there, without Greg, I'm sorry...but I didn't like it. My older brother even called from Idaho crying, saying he missed "Dad" so much, and the day didn't feel right. I suppose I wasn't the only one right.
I decided to surprise my Singaporean guest by taking him to eat Singapore Chicken Rice (SCR) in Labuan.....he he he!
Nonetheless, they didn’t. It was a defensive, counter-attacking display where City showed a distinct lack of imagination and failed to muster a single shot on target. This, in part, was down to the loss of their two best midfielders in David Silva (who missed out through injury) and Yaya Toure (who limped off early on), but even they probably would have failed to make a difference as they both have suffered a massive dip in form of late. This left them with the stagnant Gareth Barry and James Milner in midfield who created a little and struggled to keep up with the Arsenal midfield of Arteta, Song and Rosicky. And after spurning some great chances, the Gunners managed to get a deserved win following a great strike from Mikel Arteta and his ‘little feet’.

In the United States, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) is the most widely used set of symptoms. The DSM-IV-TR is a sort of encyclopedia of mental health disorders. Psychiatrists write the DSM-IV-TR and use a medical model for interpreting behavioral symptoms of mental health problems. It is important to know that this is the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the diagnosis of autism has been handled differently in each edition. As we learn more about a disorder, changes are made in the diagnostic criteria. The new diagnosis book, the DSM-V, is scheduled to be released in 2013, and it may bring substantial changes that will probably result in a narrowing of the diagnostic criteria and the number of people receiving a diagnosis of autism under the DSM-V. Outside the U.S., the ICD-10, the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases, which is published by the World Health Organization, is used. Since autism is diagnosed in individuals all over the world, it is important to recognize that the DSM-IV-TR is not the only tool used for diagnosing individuals.
Tyndall took over Morehead State in 2006, inheriting a squad that finished 4-23 the previous year. Tyndall immediately made his mark on the school, improving the team’s win total in each of his first five years. His squads won at least 20 games from 2008-11 after Morehead State reached the 20-win plateau just twice in its history prior to his arrival.
I liked the album. I liked “How Will I Know” from having seen the video, while “Saving All My Love for You” and “You Give Good Love” were great mellow love songs. It was a thoroughly decent debut.

Now that my emo moment has passed I will tell you about the suds. The annexing of the Extra Special Bitter monogram into an autumnal ale both physically and textually causes quite a stirring in my cranium. Mainly because it's troublesome to separate, examine and dissect the expectant parts and thus I won't. It starts out surprisingly sour like something you'd expect from the Jolly Pumpkin line of ales and then morphs into many parts goodness. The main corpus is a thick hop zing that tingles your tongue like a happy herpes sore and languidly evolves into a dark malt and dull powdered chocolate affect. Not in a bad way at all because it lingers there like hot chocolate does after you've long finished it off and puts you into a sort of coma of self-indulgent relaxation. While there's some toastiness on the periphery it comes across more as a remnant of some burnt chocolate pudding crust and makes you go "nom nom nom" before you fall flat on your face into the couch cushions and die slow and happily only to be resurrected a few hours later.

Cosmopoetry, sometimes termed astropoetry or astrohumanism, is a genre of poetry focused on the stars and the cosmos and our relation to astronomical phenomena. Underlying cosmopoetry is the belief that our petty human-scale strife and quarrels are diminished to near invisibility (or at least irrelevance) when viewed against the enormity of the cosmos. Indeed, cosmopoetry seeks to find that which unites us rather than divides us.

After listening to the stories and memories I couldn't help but think to myself how I am so damn proud to have my name and be a part of this family. I realized tonight that I come from a special group of women and I had no clue how many of their traits I have.
Jeb Bush campaigned vigorously in 2010 to expand such reforms, with tremendous success. About a month after the election, he unveiled his road map for implementing a far-reaching ten-point agenda for virtual schools and online coursework. Former West Virginia Governor Bob Wise, a Democrat, has barnstormed the country to encourage lawmakers to adopt Bush’s plan, which calls for the permanent financing of education-technology reforms, among other changes. In one promotional video, Wise says it is “not only about the content” of the online courses but the “process” of students becoming acquainted with learning on the Internet.

I believe one reason is because of the humility it helps to develop within us. If I am daily thanking God for _________ , then I am less likely to develop a sense of entitlement for ________ .

You’d think an “anti-bullying” law named after a boy who killed himself after constant bullying would require school districts to report bullying incidents, include provisions for enforcement and teacher training, and hold administrators accountable if they fail to act. This law does none of those things. What it does do is say that bullying is justifiable if done out of “a sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction”. This is an anti-bullying law that protects bullies.

And then there was the garbage itself. Mountains of it. We filled four 30-gallon trash bags in four long blocks (three, really, since we did only one side of Eastern and Sterling), which must have totaled nearly 100 pounds of trash. The sheer volume demanded a reflection on consumption, packaging, and waste. Individual items caught our eyes, too, turning the walk into an exercise in detective work or recent archaeology: along with the endless 25-cent bags of chips and rotting coupon circulars, we found receipts and holiday lists, thousands of wayward packing peanuts, a bag containing diapers, condoms, and pregnancy tests (my rendition of "The Circle of Life" was quickly hushed), and even some lost bits of clothing, some of which was certainly not outerwear. There was humor to be found in it, but also some idea of the lives that go on around us.

After my brother killed himself, my parents, understandably, had a rough time. It was a difficult time for all of us, but my parents couldn't seem to move on from the guilt and the pain. They were in so much pain and filled with such anger, anger that just grew and grew, that they essentially were no longer living. I remember telling my dad that he was doing my brother no good. The guilt he felt about being a bad parent wasn't serving any purpose except to destroy another life. It made more sense to take the lessons learned and to be a better father, grandfather, friend, person...

But so often the broken-hearted and the lost think there is no way God could ever love them. They ask God, “Do you know who I am? Have you seen the things I’ve done?” I know I did. I was pretty sure at one point that there was no way anyone could ever love me if they knew who I was and all the things I’d done, especially not someone like the God of the Universe.

I woke with a start from my nightmare about falling down a mineshaft, and in the dull red glow coming through our bedroom window, I saw my four-year-old sister. She’d tangled herself up in an old petticoat Mum puts on her at bedtime. We sleep on the floor and our beds are potato sacks stuffed with hay. Sara shares hers with my big sister Maria, on the other side of the room from me.
An intriguing and unexpected comment from a Facebook friend who has followed my blog inspired today’s post. After saying some very nice things about my writing, she asked me, “Did you feel a sense of synchronicity when you met Traci? I’m extremely intrigued by the theory of synchronicity and ‘feel’ that it has a tendency to play its hand in fate and destiny. If you have a story to share I would love to hear it.” Well, I do have a story to share, actually several stories, and a confession to make. But first, I’d like to examine the question: what is synchronicity, anyway? From Wikipedia:

CIC observed that the appellant sought information which was, admittedly, the intellectual property of AIIMS. Section 8(1)(d) of the RTI Act was attracted only when disclosure of information harmed the competitive position of a third party and not of AIIMS itself. Even if AIIMS was treated as a third party, it was not a commercial organisation that competed with other organisations. Further, it was not proved that the experts who prepared the question papers were in a competitive business such that disclosure of these question papers along with their keys could harm their competitive position. In view of the same, the Respondents' contention that the information sought was exempt under Section 8(1)(d) of the RTI Act was rejected. Further, Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1957 was held to be impertinent as the fact situation did not satisfy the requisite statutory
Oh and do you know the story behind the “super fast, super healing, super glue”? Be sure to watch Crows Zero first. Funny thing here is that Tokio, on a brink of a moment, even thought of using said glue when he was hit in the head by Housen. I was secretly hoping the Mikami brothers saw that but they were fighting on the other side. Makes me wonder now, which film is funnier. Even though more dramatic and more action-packed, Crows Zero II has lots of funny scenes too.

She's getting so good at playing Peek-a-boo. When you say, "Where's Abby?" she covers her eyes (sometimes she covers her ears, but I think it's because she's misjudged where her eyes are, lol.) Then we she uncovers them we say, "There she is!" and she just laughs :) She is a climber. She climbs up on the PBK chairs. She can now get into the little rocking chair. At the doctor's office it wasn't good enough to climb up onto the little purple chair, she had to climb up onto the biggest chair as well. At Grandma's house she pushes the little foot stool across the room and uses it to get onto the ottoman or the couch. When we go outside she makes a beeline for the stairs and wants to climb up those. It's driving me crazy! She's the kid who will break a bone first, I'm sure of it.

Our household already has a useful stash of shopping bags, and are in the routine of using them, but I realized we could do with some reusable produce bags. Although we re-use them a lot of the time, I found that we were always coming home with a few more plastic produce bags every time we bought our fruit and veg. Inspired by some handmade mesh produce bags I saw on flickr, and this tutorial from Wisdom of the Moon, I hit our local second hand shops and found a sheer mesh curtain to re-purpose. One evening with my overlocker (aka serger) later I had a set of 10 mesh bags.

It was, according to the ODNB, while he was in practice in Southsea that Conan Doyle acquired as a patient Major-General Alfred Wilks Drayson, who ‘exposed him to theosophy’. When we started out to seek advice on the series we now call ‘Spiritualism and Esoteric Knowledge’ (and there was quite a lot of discussion about the series title), we were a little taken aback at the number of serious nineteenth-century people who took the whole area of spiritualism seriously. After all, Mesmer and his animal magnetism may have taken eighteenth-century Europe by storm, but even during his lifetime Da Ponte and Mozart could expect their audience to laugh at the idea of two silly and flirtatious girls being convinced by a ‘mesmerist’ doctor. The joke would not work if ‘he’ was just a fake medical man: ‘he’ needed to be a complete fake, performing a con trick full of cod Latin which only a woman would fall for.
We wandered around the various shops, which were eerily reminiscent of Seattle’s Pike Place. All the buildings on the pier were super brightly painted, so of course I wanted to live in all of them. There were a couple of jazz bands and we accidentally went into a fenced-off area where our bags needed to be checked for whatever reason, but there really wasn’t anything going on. When we were satisfied that we’d seen everything that was happening, we joined a friend for dinner and drinks in the hopes that when we left, there would be less kids and more drunk, promiscuous women showing off their tits. By the time we got out of Bubba Gumps, where everyone in the damn restaurant is celebrating their 21st birthday until the end of time, there were pretty much no people on the streets. It was unfortunate because we had dragged old Lames Foreman out to Mardi Gras with the promise of boobs, but I had another engagement to rush off to so, disappointed though I was, I had to dash anyway.

As the wedding approached, I knew that my feelings toward him had grown (even though I had never told him that I liked him). I had even tried to convince myself, my friends and everyone who asked that I DID NOT have an interest. Furthermore, I would go into detail as to how it would never work out even if he did like me. Afterall, I am 6 years older, live on the West Coast and he lived on the East Coast. I had 2 children, been divorced, etc. In addition, I didn't even think he would be interested in me since he never flirted with me. He gave no indication that he was interested and he also mentioned how women had mistaken his generosity for romance in the past. I was careful not to assume anything!

By the time we got to the hospital, Claire was in a coma and they’d put her on a life-support machine and sent us to another room. A nurse came in and told us she had bleeding in her brain. Carol, my sister, asked if they would operate. The nurse said, “Oh no, normally they don’t operate with a bleed on the brain, the person just dies.” All Claire’s relatives in the room started to cry – except for me, I was in shock. A couple of hours later a surgeon came in and said he was going to operate. Carol asked if Claire would live and he said, “Of course she will, but we’ll see what we’re dealing with at the end of it.” I could have kissed him.
The reason I am writing about this is because, looking back on how I felt and the way I handled it all tells me that I need to do somethings to help myself out. I am not handling my anxiety/depression well and I think it's time I went back to someone to talk about it or get something medicinal to help me focus. At times I feel like I am weak for needing this but then other times I see that at least I can recognize the warning signs rather than letting get as bad as it got several years ago. This time I am choosing to get some help and it feels better. Hopefully soon, I will get back to feeling really good...one step at a time.

.... I was a bit under the weather mid-week, and come Thursday when I was feeling better I had already arranged to have a stroll to the local cinema to see "War Horse" with my husband in the evening. God knows we see little enough of each other what with work, commuting, household chores and (in my case) crafting; so I decided for once to prioritise having some quality "couple" time and let my DT card slide lol! I think it must have done me good, cos when I finally sat down to it last night I felt quite in the mood to create.
I pray you enjoy the holiday season!!!!!!! Eat well, drink well, and love well!!!!!!!! And whatever you do, look within to find the vision that God has deposited in your heart. He placed it there for you to see your greatest potential!!!!!!
While such emotional reactions probably feel good to the reactionary spouting them (who is, by the way, trying to articulate perfectly legitimate concerns about something having gone terribly wrong in this country), they ignore some simple facts about the Constitution itself. Without going into all the details about the facts which support a Hamiltonian power grab (Boston T. Party does a fine job of this all by himself in his “Hologram of Liberty”), splitting hairs about “of” or “for”, or devolving into yet another academic Spooner tug-fest, we can let the Constitution speak for itself.

The group collaboration tools allow group members to see all contributing resources so they might find similar and supporting information in the sources linked. This also allows members to double check the authenticity of sources and the information provided. The notes and highlights made can also be shared with the group. One person can quickly create the bibliography, their is no waiting for group members to write out or provide their sources as long as those sources are stored in the Zotero library.
I saw an error on http://www.interfaithcalendar.org/NewYears.htm, and have sent a request to correct it, which they need time to verify. They have given the Salivahana Saka Era and left out the Kaliyuga date and called it a Hindu Date.
I remember when we had first started dating. Fresh from my recent divorce, I was terrified for him to meet my mother. She was the refined ex-pastor's wife, prim and proper, and a bit judgmental. Hubby was the opposite of what we were all used to. I was terrified of what she would think.
Janice Gaines is currently working on her debut album, to be released in the Fall of 2012. Noted for her soaring soprano range and a rich, clear tone, and supported by several of the biggest names in Gospel and Christian music, including Mary Mary, Donald Lawrence and Natalie Grant, Janice Gaines is positioned as one of the leading female vocalists in gospel music’s new generation of artists.” -(OneDayMusic)
Q3.) Is there anything you like that’s boxed, but you secretly think it’s sometimes better than homemade? I really do like boxed brownie mix brownies, even though I change up the flavor a bit by using Greek yogurt instead of oil and adding vanilla extract.
Jesus had changed his audience here vs. 54 says he was speaking to the multitudes, always without fail when it is the multitudes Jesus say’s what would be considered maybe an offensive statement. I don’t mean to offend I mean aggressive to get your attention and definitely to weed out the ones who were just there to see the commotion. It’s like a car wreck you don’t want to see anyone hurt but you can’t help looking.
Now that Ive had time to step back and adapt to this stupid economy, Ive started to get inspired again. Im inspired to make myself a new wardrobe is what Im inspired to do! I would like one of each of these dresses to wear to work and then I would like one of each in black for all those cocktail parties that I'll go to again one day.
In the second version there, I left out one argument that I discussed the first time. Between saying that he doesn’t believe in God by choice, and saying that the atheological evidentialist objector may regard the theist-without-evidence as sick or malfunctioning, Plantinga argues that there is not a general obligation to have evidence for everything you believe, thus:
The message?
I agree with Mooney that this delusion-conviction effect has done grievous harm to our once-scientific and rational nation. And anyone would have to be deaf, blind, and in hysterical denial not to see these trends operating, in tsunami proportions, among our Republican neighbors.

Thank you all for reading and participating in my little blog and book reviews! I'm always soooo soooo very happy to share tidbits about my life and also especially excited to bring exciting authors and books your way. As you know, over the fall, I hosted an extreme book giveaway where the first grand prize winner never showed up to claim her 25 books. We had to choose another winner. I'm excited to announce the new winner here in a few seconds.
aw what the heck... it's our birthday, and presents rock, so let's do them all!!!
The Facebook session focused on three things to do right now to grow your Facebook fan page. All of them were fairly easy, and I have to admit that I need to work on my Facebook page. (You do all at least like my page, right?) And no, I haven't implemented anything since I got back from Blissdom, much to my chagrin. Unfortunately, I've been under the weather since I got back, so I'm lucky just to start getting caught up on laundry!

That would be these, I believe. If I'm wrong, someone please tell me. As you can see, there are three of them, and unless I am more confused than I think I am, these go into the beater bar to...uh...pack the weft together (I'm sure there's a technical term for that) as you weave. They are rusty, but don't appear rough or pitted, so I think I can clean them up and use them.
And that seemed like enough. Except the cookies. The last Tuesdays with Dorie recipe of them all, posted appropriately over a week late. There's nothing I could say that my mother hasn't said better.

Under such circumstances, who has the stronger claim to speak on behalf of the people: the president or the legislative majority that opposes his policies? Since both derive their power from the votes of the people in a free competition among well-defined alternatives, a conflict is always possible and at times may erupt dramatically. Theme is no democratic principle on the basis of which it can be resolved, and the mechanisms the constitution might provide are likely to prove too complicated and aridly legalistic to be of much force in the eyes of the electorate. It is therefore no accident that in some such situations in the past, the armed forces were often tempted to intervene as a mediating power. (source)
The casual availability of images now is both a blessing and a curse. It makes me treasure each image a little less, perhaps because I haven't spent so much effort on the hunt. Still, I'm grateful to be able to find so many digital images in cyberspace. But I have faith that there's much more to be discovered. The internet may be a million miles wide, but it's only an inch deep when it comes to some artists who have yet to arrive from obscurity.
Happy Gilmore mixes a lot of vulgar sex jokes and slapstick humor with some incredibly absurd elements. It is the absurdity which saves the film. His grandmother is trapped in a slave labor nursing home run by the hilariously sinister unaccredited Ben Stiller playing the mustache twirling villain to a tee. The famous fist fight with bob barker is the biggest highlight, but it is followed closely by Gilmore’s ’Happy place” featuring the lovely Julie Bowen in her underwear.
If one holds these high principles clearly before one’s eyes, and compares them with the life and spirit of our times, then it appears glaringly that civilized mankind finds itself at present in grave danger, In the totalitarian states it is the rulers themselves who strive actually to destroy that spirit of humanity. In less threatened parts it is nationalism and intolerance, as well as the oppression of the individuals by economical means, which threaten to choke these most precious traditions.
But Wiglaf and Beowulf work together to kill the dragon: Wiglaf stabs it in the belly, which reduces the fire, and Beowulf cuts or pierces it in the middle to finish it off.
Peaceful. A sensory explosion of all senses but taste, but sometimes I think I can smell honeysuckle on my tongue. Yesterday, all desire for material things outside my surroundings or myself drifted away like the gentle, departing wake from a sailboat. I felt centered, balanced, and restored. Invigorated.
It has also been confirmed that Dario Argento has begun pre-production on his newest film, the conclusion of his Three Mothers Trilogy, under the working title Mother Of Tears. The film will be set in Rome and will center around Mater Lachrymarum. Dario himself and Jace Anderson share writing credits for this movie. A joint effort between the Itallian Studio, Medusa, and the American Studio, Myriad Pictures (which made Jeepers Creepers) will finance the production of the film giving it a large budget, at least compared to his earlier work, and Max Von Sydow has signed on to play an as yet unknown role.
Whilst doing some research for Z, I was reminded of this little beauty! From the same author who wrote Winnie The Pooh, this rounds off my A to Z perfectly! enjoy!
When I look back, I'm just a bit upset about Merry-Go-Round's albums. We weren't flexible or experienced enough to contain all the good ideas in the album.
We spent most of the afternoon at home and then, like we do every Saturday, headed over to my brother's home. The middles love my nephews, their two cousins.
So here is a shot of the late, great Eric Morecambe, the taller half of the legendary comedy double act that was Morecambe and Wise. They had been together since the 1940s until Eric's death in 1984. Ernie Wise passed away in 1999.
It is chilly and raining outside and I think I heard sleet hitting my windows earlier today. A perfect day for staying in and quilting.

St. Patrick’s Day is tomorrow, and it gave me a little inspiration to write about some ways to go green inside your home. I’ve already given you some suggestions for making some green cleaning products, but it’s always helpful to know some little tips to help “green up” your life.
but you do it while looking in the mirror.
After the little ones left today I drug myself to the couch for a much needed rest then it was on to cutting out a few projects I would like to get in the mail Saturday. Hope I can get a start on some things tomorrow since I will only have Mason, once the garden gets going I will be up to my eyeballs in weeds, canning and dehydrating gotta sew while I still have the extra time.
Several foreign media reports have predicted that the Najib administration may have to postpone the 13th general election due to a possible negative backlash on the government over its handling of last Saturday’s protest.
Finally, I have decided to pay attention to signs all around me. I have always done so, but I have become infinitely more sensitive to what the universe is trying to tell me, whether I will be ridiculed for this or not. The other day when I was driving from work, consumed by anxious thoughts, I looked out to see an incredible rainbow. I found consolation in its glorious beauty as the arch put my mind to ease.

Many people new to first person reenacting think that they have to know “everything about everything” when creating a persona, every battle, every politician, every tool etc. The truth is, if it's not something that you'd care to know about in the modern world, why would your historic self want to know it in their time? I can relate the recipe for a double chocolate mocha brownies by heart, but heck if I know the name of my senator; my historic self is no different!

Labors of love by their nature take some work. But you can tell the difference. In this case, you can taste the difference. Officially these morsels are called Bran Flax Muffins, but that sounds about as appealing as cardboard, so I’ve rechristened them Morning Glory Muffins, which better conveys their nutty appeal. These are like a ray of sunshine greeting you in the kitchen.

This post began with the treasure we have. Wake up! If someone finds a treasure, it contains more than one item. There is a chest full of items. When they went down to the Titanic, they found the ship, but it was heavy laden with many things of value. People are still fascinated with them. God has much to show us and desires to give us insights to His glory. Look at this short list:

I don't like looking at chemtrails, I've always had a bad feeling about them, the reason being the high potential we are witnessing the ongoing anthropogenic battle for control of Nature. It bothers me to see something so obvious be ignored and denied. They illustrate perfectly for all to see, the vast void of respect westernized humanity bears toward the natural world preferring to throw its full support into a broken system. And chemtrails are ugly, far too Jackson Pollack binging on jet fuel for my taste.

Episode 3 begins with Gai announcing the presence of the Undertakers to Japan and their mission statement, and then basically never really feature in this episode. Instead, we get whacky high-school antics! The guys all go on about how hot she is! And then she moves in with Shu and whacky ecchi comedy happens! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
I owe some thanks to Cori, who explained dreamspell to me. She’s also an avid cyclist, and DJ. She is definitely adept at the spinning of cycles. Hi Cori! As I was getting a grip on these Maya cycles within cycles of time, she mentioned in passing that she found that bicyclists had an easier time picking this stuff up than others. This has stayed with me, somewhere in the back of the vast space inside my skull, and hence this post.
my mother liked - like, EVER - I would invariably never know what I should draw for her and so I'd sit sucking the end of my 2HB wondering if she'd like flora or fauna, building or landscape, portrait or still-life. Eventually I'd do what I always did and infuriate her further with a: "Muu-uuuummm?

My wife is a very reasonable woman. She told me to go out and find a hot 25-year-old gal, and she would make sure that I would once again be living in a cheap apartment, driving a cheap car, sleeping on a sofa bed and watching a 10-inch black and white TV.

Now on to my argument: accessible post-secondary education provides both individual and collective benefits. If an individual invests wisely in post-secondary studies she is likely to find higher paying work upon graduation and will earn more over the course of her career. On a collective level we as a society benefit from having more people graduate from universities because it makes us smarter, innovative, and more competitive. As such, it is to our benefit to have well-funded world class universities which act as engines of economic growth.

52% of Iowans see their senior senator Chuck Grassley favorably, and 33% unfavorably. They are not as hot on Tom Harkin, giving him a 46-40 mark, but that still puts him in a tie for 50th out of 86 senators on which we've polled. Grassley is tied for 25th. The two are equally popular with their own bases, but Grassley, at 39-45 with Democrats, is way more popular across the aisle than is Harkin (a still healthy 23-64 with Republicans). Grassley also bests Harkin with independents, 50-34 versus 39-45.

Your assignment, if you choose to accept it, is to "Invite a Blogger to Your Table"! This is a fun event and an outlet for us each to challenge ourselves and create stronger bonds within the blogging community. Nothing is more intimate, or more effective at creating friendships than cooking and sharing meals together, even it is virtually. But hey, if you live in the same area as another blogger what's to stop you from gathering in your own kitchen for this challenge.

Temple has tried to summarize the Pistols on film before, but like the band members themselves, he found himself swayed and misled by McLaren. His 1980 The Great Rock 'N' Roll Swindle is a bizarre mockumentary, started in the aftermath of the group's final concert in January 1978 but before it all truly collapsed. Yet the movie clearly bears McLaren's stamp of approval and manipulative hand, and it's notably today mainly for the brazen, self-serving myths conjured by McLaren. The Filth and the Fury seeks to rectify that shambles of a film by presenting the band's side (including Lydon's and Matlock's, both of whom were omitted from Temple's first go-around with the punks). Curiously, Temple frames their talking heads in shadow, masking their faces as they come clean about their brief time together. They look as if they're in witness protection, hiding from what they wrought.
When we set off at the crack of dawn for EcoColors Whale Shark Adventure, I didn't know what to expect. I certainly didn't expect this Mayan warrior above, jumping and waving his talisman on the dock. I think he was wishing us vaya con Dios Americanos estupidos. It did not feel comforting but what did I know?

I returned to Warcraft this past fall. I’d stopped playing in May-ish and missed pretty much everything from May to August. I rejoined my guild and found that they needed me almost right off the bat because of the difficulty of recruiting for 25-mans on our server. It took me a little while to get a grasp on my moonkin-ness again, but that was nothing compared to the Firelands learning curve.
I won't be rushing into any baking right away, we've started phase 4 of the kitchen remodel. I want this done before the baby gets here or it'll never happen!

This year, they would like to purchase a vending machine and retro fit it so that it will vend small pieces of art created by local artists. The prices for the art will range from $1-$20. If I understand correctly, the location of the vending machine will rotate through out Ames giving access to more people.

Attention Deficit Hyper Disorder (ADHD) is a common diagnosis for men, women, and children in the U.S. It seems like we all know five or more people who have this condition. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that more than 1.5 million adults are medicated for ADHD. There have been mumblings that such drugs can increase blood pressure and heart rate. A study by Kaiser Permanente Northern California did not confirm that these medications cause any possible risks.
One of the most interesting things I could find was this little graph which I think they have gotten from the International Scientific Forum on Alcohol Research, a part of the University of Boston's School of Medicine, and Alcohol in moderation who state on their website (found here)

This call for an immediate moratorium on corporal punishment, stoning and the death penalty is demanding on many fronts. We are defining it as a call to consciousness of each individual so that she/he realizes that Islam is being used to degrade and subjugate women and men in certain Muslim majority societies in the midst of collusive silence and chaotic judicial opinions on the ground. This realization implies:

Last night was a great time and I thoroughly enjoyed feeling special. I marvel at the trouble people sometimes go to in order to let others know they are OK and mean something. Despite anything else that goes on, there is a lot of good in the human race.
What a dilemma. In a good way, of course. The dilemma alone is something to be thankful for! To have an abundance of fresh apples and pumpkins, plus the ability to make a gluten-free vegan homemade treat from a warm and cozy kitchen. Very, very thankful for the abundance of food and pleasures that we are able to have. Much to be thankful for, and much to share.
I am not sure if we already had weapons or not or if we ran back to the elevator to go back up to the first level to look for weapons, either way, we came back with weapons and I had a scoped laser rifle with the beam splitter upgrade from the game Fallout New Vegas; and we went back to fight the zombie-like beings, and I remember shooting the first zombie-like being that I saw several times.
After lunch if we have curriculum I still want to do and she hasn't imploded on me we continue. If we are done we play/watch tv/do errands/clean house. I am also incorporating a visit to the YMCA so I can continue with my weight loss.

* You say that a small farmers' market doesn't exist in Santa Monica? Head to Virginia Avenue Park Saturday mornings, and pick up a loaf of wonderful hazelnut cranberry bread, as well as your basic necessities. I'm also a fan of this market, because while Gloria's stand sells quality produce for half the price, there's also a stand run by Asian-American farmers, so I can pick up the veggies of my childhood (whose names I don't know in English)!
I must say, we had a really fun time. It’s always great to get out and see the breweries that produce the beers we love. People envision breweries as big factories, pumping out bottles (or cans or kegs) in mass quantity, surrounded by chaos. But the true picture is vastly different. Brew days are about technical specs, cleaning, efficiencies, and old fashioned hard work. The glorious life of a brewer looks more like construction work from the inside. It’s still pretty cool and if someone came by and offered us a brewery (*ahem*) I’m sure we’d snatch it up in a hot Maryland second.

I officially returned to writing mode at the beginning of the month when at the very last hour (actually I think I had about 3 hours to spare) I sent an entry into Jason Evan's Clarity of Night flash fiction competition. The prompt was a photograph of a crystal glass filled with red wine and the title was "In Vino Veritas". Truth in Wine. Jason had a co-host for this competition - Jaye Wells, author of Red-Headed Stepchild, who herself was a former entrant of a Clarity of Night competition. I have a huge soft spot for Jason's blog and his competitions as it is the place where I took my first tentative steps into the world of writing and it is through him I have come to know so many of you. How Jason holds down a full time job, writes so much incredible poetry and fiction, manages several blogs (although alas the Book Roast is no more), takes breathtaking photos AND runs these competitions at regular intervals, is beyond me. (Rumour has it that he's a damn fine husband and father too). I can only assume he has wizard magic or he has learned how to bend time.
Straw now says that ‘he still regularly sees women in the full veil’. How does he know that he’s really seeing different Muslim women and not the same woman dressed in different clothes? How does he know these Muslim women aren’t pulling faces at him or grimacing? How can he tell when these Muslim women haven’t fallen asleep at one of his constituency meetings?

Taking a bearing for the tree line on Matley Ridge in the distance, I cross Longwater Lawn through sinuous black fingers of recently burnt heather, the crisp ground crunching beneath my boots. A small bird flits from one brittle charred stem to the next, too far away to identify – a species of finch maybe, with its dark head perhaps a bullfinch? A line of goat willows, and the young stems of bog myrtle, indicate increasing wetness underfoot and soon the crunch becomes a squelch. In bare patches in the damp soil, I find the tracks or ‘slots’ of deer – 6 species can be found in the New Forest. Soon, the landscape, treeless save for the occasional stunted windswept birch, becomes pock-marked with small crater-like ponds, some drying, others full of rust-coloured water covered with an oily film – indicative of the peaty soil beneath. Growing in the waterlogged mud of the wetter spots, I spy sundews, a type of carnivorous plant of which there are 3 species native to Britain.
Edit: I’d be interested to know your opinions, whether or not you’ve read the book. It might be stale news now, but still worthy of discussion I feel.
Since people dress more casual in the states in general, I think I notice a big difference between their normal and their formal attire. In France, people are used to dressing nicer (again, so hard to put into words, but sweats still seem limited to the gym and certain cliques of teens). So maybe I perceive the wedding look as more casual because I don't see as big a difference with their normal clothes. Like, they could be going to a meeting at work or to a wedding. They just have nice clothes, period, no need for "special occasions" to look good.
It's not, so just answer vaguely with something like the classic "jalan jalan," which means just wandering around.
I understand nicotine from the patch made much of this possible. Still, I was amazed at how I was able to push past the physical behavior that seemed so ingrained in my daily routine. What I appreciate most about the patch — unlike the e-cigarette — is that it allows me to wean off nicotine while immediately eliminating all of the nasty habits. My hope is that once I am completely off the patch, I won’t automatically want to light up because I have cut out not only the actual cigarette, but all smoke-mimicking behaviors.
We are studying the American Revolution in my classroom. I wanted to show my students how the colonist felt over paying taxes to a distant king, so I staged a reenactment. First, I gave all the students some M&Ms in a cup. Then I appointed a student to be king and two to be tax collectors. I told all the students wearing red to raise their hand and asked the "king" if he wanted to collect taxes, M&Ms, from the students wearing red or not wearing red. The fun really began when the "king" made up more new taxes. He imposed a Girl Tax, Glasses Tax, Sibling Tax, and so on until their cups were almost empty. I will admit it got rather noisy with all the protests from the tax payers. The students were outraged! This set the stage for a lesson on the real taxes imposed on the colonist.

Other helpful health practices include reading food labels and understanding such basic nutritional concepts as daily requirements for calories, protein, fats, and nutrients. Would-be vegetarians can experiment with meat substitutes, foods that are high in protein and essential nutrients.
It is the opposite of "war", of course. So between 1991 and 2003 Saddam Hussein's subjects must have been experiencing "peace". And all through the 1950s the citizens of the Soviet Union lived in "peace".

Now it’s time for some drilling and magnet gluing… always a bit of a pain. Anyway, I glued a magnet on the neck position, one on each shoulder (on the arms side of course), and the right arm needed to get two magnets, one to attach to the shoulder (so keep your polarities correct!) and the other for the right-hands-with-huge-axes pieces. You are able now to check how those heads fit and even how the axe hands work on the right arm.
When you close the back door, on the wall to the right, is this little message board. I am proudly displaying 2 coloring book pages and Sam's report card (all A's!). I have been changing out the verse monthly. The January verse was Jeremiah 29:11...For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord. Plans to prosper you and not to harm you. Plans to give you a hope and a future.

The terrain had two hills and a woods (yeah, too lazy to put the trees on, sorry). They were all rough terrain for movement, the hills provided unobstructed LOS if you were on top and of course blocked it, and the woods gave +1 Armor cover if completely inside against Archery.

I rarely cook from a recipe, I just add ingredients in whatever proportion seems right, but I will try to explain to you how to make it as best I can. To me, the beauty of cooking is the fact that you don’t have to stick to a hard and fast recipe, you can substitute, change proportions, and add ingredients according to what’s on hand and what sounds good right then:)
I had judges who scored me as low as they could without going into negative numbers, all without comments. I had a judge who told me she’d be okay if my heroine died. I’ll admit, that one made me cry—a lot. But then I had a handful of judges who gave me okay scores, but what I loved is that they gave me a goldmine in comments.
Lunghu thought he was just joking around when he casually remarked last month that Israel wouldn’t be satisfied with bombing Iran –they’d want Jonathan Pollard released from federal prison, too. Some literalist in Tel Aviv must have thought that sounded like a good idea …

Back to the pizza… I made the Roman pizza dough that has come to be my favorite recipe. The recipe calls for the dough to be divided into 6 equal portions, but tonight out of sheer absent mindedness I divided it into 4. Turned out perfectly, since my new peel is bigger than my old one. I rolled the dough nice and thin, then dusted the peel with a little flour and built my pie.
Since the publication of J. L Martyn’s groundbreaking work, History and Theology in the Fourth Gospel (1968),[1] Johannine scholars have relied heavily upon the thesis that John’s Gospel provides a two-level story concerned with Jesus and with the struggles of the Johannine community. In other words, the conflicts and concerns of John’s community have been read back into the life of Jesus with the result that the two stories have become intertwined. There is not space here to critique Martyn’s proposal or rehearse the history of its reception among scholars. Suffice it to say that, while some of his original thesis has been qualified or discarded, many scholars still operate under the basic assumption that the Fourth Gospel tells the interrelated stories of Jesus and the Johannine community. Scholars commonly agree that the Gospel’s three references to believers being expelled from the synagogue (9:22; 12:42; 16:2) represent evidence of a conflict within the Johannine community. Since Christ followers were not being expelled from the synagogue during Jesus’ lifetime, this appears to represent a concern for John’s religious community. Among scholars, this element of the narrative remains one key to locating the struggles of John’s community in the Gospel story.

Harvest Moon's relationship with Rutgers was a side point noted to patrons of Thursday night's dinner. After the dessert course of chocolate cake pops, head brewer Kyle McDonald was kind enough to take a few moments to explain the brewpub's interdependence with Rutgers' ag program, and how Harvest Moon's executive chef, Michael "Tank" DeAngelis, added Rutgers farm bacon and beef to the anniversary dinner menu.
A metaphor is the epitome of show don't tell or figurative writing--it is using words (which typically 'tell) to 'show' something, often combining something commonly understood to whatever it is the writer wants to describe. For example instead of saying bright yellow coat you say "sunshine yellow coat" or instead of saying excruciatingly thin you say "spaghetti-noodle thin." You're using the commonality of one thing to 'show' the details of something else. You are saying something IS something else--the coat IS yellow, the girl IS thin. Some more complex metaphors are things like "She was laughter and sunshine," or "the night is thick with hatred."

When it was Adam’s turn to split his votes he had the same strategy as Cee Lo and went 60-40, for TONY. I was really surprised for two reasons: 1) Katrina Parker (who did an amazing rendition of ‘Killing Me Softly’, in what will go down as the best song choice in The Voice history) has been consistently better than Tony during the live shows, 2) Adam has been gushing week after week about how much he loves Katrina, and wants everyone else to love her, what happened?

It was hard achieving the bumps in her dress so that it looked like it went in and out but I think I got there in the end.
Once sliced I decided it was worth waiting for. I zapped it in the microwave just to warm it up a tad, and the hubby had his with whipped cream on it. It was moist, chocolate-y, nutty and very satisfying. I love nuts in my baked goods and having three different ones, each with it's own texture was great. Along with the chocolate chips with was one rich and yummy loaf. I am not sure how much better it would have been with hazelnuts. Maybe, if I ever find any, I will try this again. But, it was just fine like I made it this time.
The over-riding question I have asked myself is who governs? The conclusion I have reached today is no one. I have followed in Jonathan Powell’s Machiavellian footsteps in offering up one or two suggestions in how to wield power from the town hall.¹

A primer on Misha’s charity work up to this point: Right after the earthquake in Haiti, Misha (we’re on a first name basis, but I only call him Mishka in private, FWIW) leveraged the power and pocketbooks of his Twitter followers to raise over $30,000 for UNICEF. Awesome!

For seasoning:
Everyone was going all out this week and trying to give us something new and different to push them into the finale, and Team Cee Lo was no exception. Jamar Rogers took a break from up-tempo rock songs and gave us a softer side. He was, as always, extremely powerful and awesome–his dip to the low note at the end was amazing. The crowd went wild, and Jamar was jumping up and down with adrenaline–everyone knew he killed it. After that performance, I was thrilled, sure he would make it to the finals next week. But, it was foolish of me to discount his competition from Team Cee Lo, Juliet Simms, who closed the show with her best performance yet.
When I walk by somebody and smell this on their clothes, my immediate thought is, "Their Mama (or wife) loves them." Its just that little extra step. I use it religiously when I do laundry. It is one of my favorite things...EVER. It is on the list right under God, Family, and my camera (which is technically my 3rd child). I am really a dork when it comes to fabric softener....or just laundry in general. When I open the dryer and notice someone left hang up clothes in there, I go all
How do the numbers stack up? Based over four years, including battery lease, charging and depreciation a Kangoo ZE would cost £16,732 in London. The diesel Kangoo wouls cost £23,946. So the ZE works out £7,000 less. What’s more, Renault’s calculations were made before the government grant, which could save a further £3,390.
I'll be honest, the book had a chance with me up until the big reveal. After the big reveal that was anything but big--you'll just have to trust me, it was a flop, but I don't want to spoil the book in my review--the book just continued to go downhill.
Many powerful souls have reincarnated in this era, with a lot of power. This is true on both sides, the light and the dark. High magic is at work on both sides. Things will change, but it is up to the people how difficult or easy it is for the changes to come about.
I see the benefit of all these activities, however. First, we’ve been forced to become more organized. Dinner has to be planned, and we all have to be ready to go when we need to go or the whole day gets set back. Second, we’ve been forced to do tackle activities we don’t necessarily want to tackle but are for our benefit. For example, I realized I let tasks such as balancing the budget and laundry slide over the past month and a half. Did laundry get done? Yes. But it was on an as-needed basis, rather than regular up-keep.
Speaking of the Big D, you know how I knew there was something fishy about Ms. Kuhn (Stéphane Audran), the owner of the hotel Alan ends up staying at? Upon meeting him, she tells Alan that she thinks Dallas is a fascinating city. Fascinating?!? Dallas? It's a lot of things, but fascinating* ain't one of them. Either way, I looked at her with a truckload of suspicion after that. Add the fact that Ms. Kuhn had a creepy demeanor (catatonic with a hint of malaise), presided over a frightfully imprecise set of bangs (you couldn't equalize shelves with those things), rocked an empty baby carriage in a windowless room, and carried around a skinny black cat, and we're talking one unscrupulous landlady.

The key is to give yourself the time to write. “Not that the story need be long, but it will take a long while to make it short.” – Henry David Thoreau. To write something short and witty that still tells the tale, that’s what takes the most time, but it’s well worth it. Try to write a show description in 25 words (an upcoming concert or movie). It’s a great training field to have you start thinking about not just what adjectives you could use but instead what three words can make a real impression on who the artist is.
Biggest surprise of evening? After all those years of travel, living in Italy, San Francisco and now North Carolina, Frances Mayes still retains a southern accent! A soft sort of drawl, similar to Laura Bush’s actually.
I made the flower, after watching a tutorial on you tube, and from some tissue type paper that was in a scruffy old book I picked up in a charity shop. The pages were rather lovely, handmade with flower petals in and this stuff between each page (white tho) but the fabric cover was patchy and faded. It only cost £1 and I have about 16 just bigger than A3 pages of each type. I can definately use them somehow, the tissue in flowers for sure.
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
Even without the traditional hallmarks of seasons that grace the majority of this country, there still exist sure signs of spring here in Sunnyville. If you happen to have teens at home these signs are clear, and if you happen to work with these pubescent creatures the signs are neon, flashing, and practically scream at you on a daily basis.
Since then, I have dreamed the weirdest dreams. They have been incredibly intense. Two nights ago I awoke at 4AM and thought, "I can remember this dream. I don't have to write it down." I, of course, could not remember the dream the next day. I wrote what little I could remember in my journal and asked God to help me improve at waking up to write it down.
So after she got sick and wasn't sleeping so well, she went back to sleeping well for a couple nights... but then started waking once or twice, and then it got to four or five times. We did move her into the nursery a couple weeks ago, but still in her rock n play and still swaddled. When she kept waking up 4-5 times a night just to be rocked and put back down, or sometimes staying up for an hour, we decided it was time to sleep train!

Have you ever had your Realtor pull a Clue Report for a property you are interested in buying? I do it for my buyers. Clue Reports are a great Real-Estate tool and will tell a potential buyer if they will have a ‘hard time getting home insurance for a home they are interested in. As Connecticut Insurance Services points out: “Its CARFAX for a home”. Often times Clue Reports contain more information than the Property Disclosure Forms. These reports go back 5 years and look at the history of claims on a prospective listings.’ If in doubt or if something does not look right after viewing or doing a building inspection have your Realtor request a Clue Report. It can provide you with more insight and potentially save a closing from coming to a screeching hold when you cannot secure home insurance. Per Connecticut Services: “All mortgage companies require that their customers purchase property insurance coverage on any structures secured by their mortgage. ” So why not find out right from the start if you as the potential buyer are going to have a difficult time securing said insurance.

A lot of very worrying and scary stories were told about warranty and indemnity clauses and how some educational writers had been caught out with this. Even an alleged breach may mean you are liable to pay. It was recommended that this clause be removed from contracts. I also learnt it is possible to take out Professional Indemnity and Public Liability Insurance with the NUJ if you are a member.
Living here for almost a year, I have experiences so may things here in San Felipe. Meeting people and seeing things that you wouldn’t see anywhere else are just perks to living in a foreign country. I have met many great people that I wouldn’t have met if I hadn’t moved here. I am grateful that I had this opportunity. I now plan on traveling within life. If anyone has the chance of ever going to a Baja race, traveling to Mexico, or even traveling in general, I say go for it! It is a great life experience! Live life for yourself. Make a trip somewhere once a year. Do it for you.

My alarm didn't even have to go off. I had been up well before the 6:05 alarm. I got myself ready, watched some TV and met my friends in the lobby around 6:30 am. We were instructed to be in our corrals by 6:45 am. 35,000 runners were expected to run the race! We found our way easily to our corral (we were in corral "O", out of corrals A-Z) and thus began the long freeze. Thank goodness for good tunes blaring over the loud speakers and beach balls bouncing around to keep me moving. It was a great atmosphere! The race started and 17 minutes later we crossed the starting line.
Then it was lunch and we saved some cash on the grill so we used it for a lunch at Momoyas, a Japanese place near out house. I had steak and shrimp, Bobina rocked some chicken and shrimp.

SUPER BODY, SUPER BRAIN incorporates an active use of motor skills. The importance of exercising balance and coordination may help improve children’s brain functioning in the following areas: attention, memory, multitasking, spatial memory and decision-making. For example raising heels and arms at the same time will improve kids’ attention and multitasking skills. This could correlate to listening to the teacher and writing in a piece of paper)

The dressing table is not really a table but a French Provencal commode... The existing green paintwork was in excellent condition when I found it, a touch faded, so mostly anything looks pretty sitting on the top. In pride of place is a vintage hat stand, or hat 'head size' model to be exact and she is wearing a feather collar wrapped across her head with one of my mother's diamonte brooches pinned at the top. I have a collection of leather, porcelain and glass boxes arranged on the top and these I can throw my trinkets in... bracelets, brooches, necklaces... but most of the time I leave them laying out on the top... Accessorising is so much easier if I can see what's what... Besides, I don't know about you, but I seem to get set in my ways and wear the same jewellery for months on end... and then, when the mood strikes, I swap it all up and move onto other pieces... Right now, I am crazy for bracelets... especially the ones that wrap around and around... Truthfully, I have always loved a good bangle...
Many thanks for making a documentary film on the Buddha, the Prince of Peace and Compassion. We would particularly like to thank the award-wining filmmaker David Grubin for making a film on such a matter of profound significance. We also understand the film is being aired by PBS – Public Broadcasting Service – on April 7th, 2010 with its nearly 360 member stations all over the United States of America and 110 million people through their local stations and nearly 19 million people online are expected to watch it.
You had all your pretty figures in a row: how long we’d been together, how much money we’d spent together, how many divided dollars you’d given me, how “savvy” I’d been to pay off my card each month. Yeah, well, if I’d been really “savvy” I never would have taken up with you in the first place!
The audience in this paper is anyone who thinks that baseball is all about hanging out in the dugout messing around with your teammates and being lazy. I want to show these people that the players take the game very seriously and that there is a lot of testosterone on the field.
It's understood that adults will have different interests based on their own personal tastes and preferences, and those different interests are generally at least marginally respected (while an interest in comic books might not be respected overly much, it's probably unlikely someone will be told to their face they should be reading classic lit instead), yet most often children get very different treatment. Like ideas on the necessity of Shakespeare, many parents think that their list of things that have been most enriching in their lives will also prove the most enriching to their children, if only they teach them about it.

After a slightly hung over start to Sunday morning we embarked on a treasure hunt of a different kind. Since I got an android phone with GPS, the world treasure hunting game of Geocaching has captured my interest. All over the place, unbeknownst to the "muggles" -that is, the nongeocaching folk - there are hidden containers. You search for them following the coordinates given, find the hidden cache and leave a note that you've been there. Sometimes the caches have things to swap in them - treasures, of a sort. You take an item, you leave an item in exchange. And it's all supposed to be done in secret, so that the muggles don't find out.

On the seventh day, at the zenith of his anguish, David smashed open the cabinet containing his ancestor’s keepsakes and, carefully picking through the shards of glass, retrieved the journal. The boy was found several hours later by the stable master , rifling through the pages of the manuscript, with a look upon his face of someone who had recently discovered first-hand what genitalia were actually for. When he was brought before his Father and Mother with not a trace of shame visible they both turned a strange purple colour. Almost as a mirror image of one another, shaking bodily, lips tightly pursed with the occasional squealing expulsion of air escaping them, accompanied by something guttural and constrained that started In each of their throats and differed only slightly in pitch. Then came the roaring – a twin stream of high volume words that crashed against one another and knocked David arsewards in ecstasy. To him the cacophony was like a choir of angels, as if heaven had split the sky and emptied all the wonders of existence directly into his ears with enough force to split his skull.

There is nothing more chaotic and exhausting then renovating one home while packing up and preparing to move the other with a teething 9 month old in tow. No wait; renovating, packing, teething 9 month old and condo neighbors starting extensive and noisy all day renovations. Naptimes can already be a struggle, so adding noisy banging is the kiss of death. Goodbye calm days, goodbye mommy-time. If that wasn’t enough, schedule and routine; the foundations of a happy baby (and happy mommy) have been thrown out the window as I am now prepared to drop everything at a moment’s notice to run to meet with tradespeople for estimates or to pay for work completed if my husband can’t make it. As Dr Phil would say, “This ain’t my first rodeo” – we have bought, gutted and totally renovated a property before –but never before with child. And yes, I am aware I just quoted Dr Phil.

I also made a Backpack Mini Album. I worked on it through April and had planned on giving it to my niece to give to her preschool teacher for an end of the year gift. Then life happened well, I had one page left to do, and then my not-so-fun hospital filled May happened. School ended. I was still hospitalized, and I couldn't give it to her. I was so upset! At least they didn't ASK me to make it, and didn't even know I had made it, so they weren't dissapointed, but I was. I AM. So now i will have to think of a different use for it. Maybe I will just put pictures of my niece in it to document her preschool year! We shall see. I took pictures of it, but they don't do it justice, and there are just a TON of them. So instead, I will shoot a video of it. I LOVE the album!! I will try to do the video this week so that I can share it with you all! :) Here is a sneak peek though!!

I've bought less books; in part due to no longer working at Oxfam so I'm less tempted. Instead I've read what I've already got. Don't we all have things on the bookshelf that we've barely had time to skim through before the next book is bought? In general without the temptation of a weekly visit to town now I'm not working there, I've spent less. I've no need to buy myself a sandwich for lunch for example which I use to treat myself to periodically.

The real surprise of the day was the George Peabody Library, formerly the Library of the Peabody Institute of the City of Baltimore, which opened in 1878, designed by Baltimore architect Edmund G. Lind. I was familiar with the area because my associate Hector Alexander Samada had completed an interior design project on the top floor of a Romanesque Revival townhouse just on the other side of the Washington Monument. But I had never been inside the library, a research facility open to the public, now part of Johns Hopkins University.
Despite this post, so much has been left unsaid about my great-grandmother. It's impossible for me to communicate in print--the feeling of a hug from her, the warm floury frying smells of her kitchen, or the sound of her gently brittle and loving voice and quiet chuckle. But Norma Verneal Smires represented the best this country has to offer. She was kind, loving, hardworking, unafraid to face adversity, and steadfast in her beliefs even as she adapted to the changing world around her.

I don't know. I'm beyond thrilled to he trying so soon. I'm beyond thrilled that this option is even available to us. I'm angry that my body can no longer do what it's supposed to do and what comes naturally for everyone else is going to cost me a small fortune.

Michelle Williams – in Louis Vuitton
A week and a half ago the big day was there, we left the house early, for a girlie day filled with roller coasters. To make a whole day of it, we would stop half way for a cup of coffee as you do when you take a day trip. But somewhere in between getting out of the car and into the highway cafe (which was according to us more likely the waiting room for death) my iphone slipped out of my hand, and met the pavement. Luckily only the glass cracked and it still worked, this was not gonna stand in my way.
I've learned some things about Legos. If you like assembling things, you love them because they're so precise. But the play value doesn't end there. You can change them around, borrow from this piece and add to that one. You can supplement your "grownup" small-size Legos with the bigger Duplos you've been playing with since you were two. You can take apart your enormous Duplo zoo, perhaps leaving behind all the animals but reusing the building blocks and little people.

9. Create and nurture ‘the correct culture.’ – Watson, Sr had created the original culture of IBM but over the years, IBM personnel had moved away from the original ethos of that culture and had started to interpret it quite differently to how it was originally intended. LG made it an imperative to change the IBM culture that was a better reflection and fit for the changing times. The original culture hinged around:
The hookup is very cool as well. One side is liquid eyeliner and the other side is a pretty sheer lip gloss. I have a love of what The Man calls "lip stuff." This includes lip balm, lip stick, lip gloss, lipstick...I can never have enough. This one leaves my lips moisturized and have a shimmery color. It's perfect to wear alone or to put over a lip pencil or lipstick. The eyeliner is easy to use and makes super precise lines. This is important because I'm a little apprehensive of liquid eyeliner. This one goes on well but I'm still not a fan of liquid liner. Give me a pencil any day! Since you can customize your hookup I would get something else, like a perfume, in the future. Or maybe a different lip gloss...

Edward Lear himself suffered from severe and debilitating episodes of epilepsy and was prone to lifelong periods of intense depression that he deemed “the morbids.” During his lifetime, he was primarily known as a travel artist (despite partial blindness) and all-around eccentric fellow. Despite this, he remains the only author I know who wrote a paean to inter-species love now considered appropriate literature for young children. But you’ll understand why if you know the poem, or if you read it following the cut.

The girls giggled as B.J. flared his nostrils and slowly swiveled his head toward the back of the room. “Oh right, the farmboys are in this class! You should bathe more, Hansen. You too, Maguire.

Gabriella is a talking machine now. She repeats everything we say and we really need to start watching our mouths. She runs around like a madwoman, loves to sing and dance (she can plie, and when we tell her to be a ballerina she puts her arms over her head and twirls), and is working on a couple incisors (I believe that's what they're called - the fang teeth?). She is such a joy and we adore her so so much.
I am so stunned. Why did I never try this before?
We're putting together details of our upcoming trip to Ogunquit, Maine, at the end of April. We'll be staying in a B&B in Ogunquit and then visiting our friends Wil and Fritz for a couple of nights. We're also working on details for Bear Week in Provincetown in July.....year four! And I see a road trip maybe next week to Boise for just me and Mason....to see the parents and sister. And maybe help sis get a new laptop up and running. We saw The Descendents last night. Great movie. I had no clue what it was about or even who was in it. That's the third Academy Award nominee that we've seen -- in addition to The Help and The Iron Lady. Sounds like all movies have to begin with the word "The" nowadays.

Paul rejoiced that the Thessalonians, on hearing His word, received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectively works also in you who believe. It performed such a work as not only to “turn them from their idols to serve the living God” but also “to wait for His son from heaven … who delivered us from the wrath to come!”(1 Thess. 1:9-10).

In 2011, spending on equipment is predicted to jump to nearly $190 billion dollars in the United States alone. That’s up from $175 billion in 2010. By 2014, that number should be more than $217 billion dollars.

Until recently, the caja banking system was virtually unregulated. Yes, you read that correctly, until about 2010-2011 there were next no regulations for these banks (which account for 50% of all Spanish deposits). They didn’t have to reveal their loan to value ratios, the quality of collateral they took for making loans… or anything for that matter.

So goodbye to Fool’s Day. Here’s remembering my favourite character the Fool giving the audience my favourite quote in my favourite Shakespeare play, King Lear:
Today is no different. We have liberal Christians who claim false truths and mislead millions in the name of love. We have hardline fundamentalists who distort the word of God because they fear secular society. We have scientists who claim God is a myth and an ancient cultural creation. We have different religions that all tell us we are wrong and should convert to their beliefs.
Very luckily, I have an awesome husband who does cool stuff like suprising me with a trip to Napa for my birthday. So I am peacing out on Friday, and leaving my bullshit behind for a weekend, in order to enjoy my husband and all of the greenery, good food and coastal views (maybe) that northern Cali can possibly offer us in two days. Because of this, however, I must work extra hard today and tomorrow, since I don’t want to be in the awkward position of having to leave my bosses to finish my work (which they would have to, since I absolutely refuse to cancel this trip or to work while in Napa). Plus, I think they may be trying to work me to death — since my death would be cheaper than laying me off (I think they have life insurance me, to boot) — and I’m not havin’ any of that.
Diseases are where your main problems will be, at least if you live in New England. We have a whole host of diseases that will spot up the leaves and slowly kill the plant. Many of them are hard to tell from one another. The basic care is to remove the diseased branch and dispose of it when you find it. To make disease less likely you can stake your plants instead of caging them. This lets the air flow through better. If you do cage, you can thin out the branches in the interior of caged plants.

However, authors can do their bit by presenting positive fictional role models. How are we doing? This is where I need readers to get involved! With all the writing I’ve been doing, I’ve been slack on my reading. I try to keep abreast of the big YA releases, but inevitably fall behind. From where I’m sitting however, young LGBT characters are massively under represented. Queer and Curious characters are seemingly non-existent.
This is the way that a legate ought to deal with the estates of the empire at the diet. He should hold God’s commandment before them and make of it an unavoidable necessity, and say: “Dear lords, emperor, and princes, if you would be emperor and princes, act as emperor and princes, or the Turk will teach you with God’s wrath and disfavor. Germany, or the empire, is given you and committed to you by God, that you may protect, rule, counsel, and help it, and you not only should, but must do this on pain of losing your soul’s salvation and God’s favor and grace. But now it is evident that none of you takes this seriously, or believes it, but you take your office as a jest, as though it were a mummery of the carnival, for you leave the subjects, whom God has committed to you, to be so wretchedly harassed, taken captive, put to shame, plundered, slain, and sold by the Turk. Do you not think, since Go has committed this office to you, and has given you money and people besides for you to do good to them, that He will demand at your hands all the subjects whom you so shamefully deserted, while you danced, reveled, showed off, and gambled? If you seriously believed that you were appointed and ordained of God to be emperor and princes, you would leave your banqueting and rivalry for high places and other unprofitable display for awhile, and consult faithfully how you might discharge your office and fulfill God’s commandment and rescue your consciences from all the blood and the misery which the Turk inflicts upon them. For how can God, or any godly heart think otherwise of you than that you hate your subjects or have a secret covenant with the Turk or, at least, hold yourselves for neither emperor nor princes, but for dolls and puppets for children to play with? Otherwise, it would be impossible that your consciences should let you rest, if you seriously held yourselves for overlords appointed by God, and were not to speak and advise together about these matters differently than you have done heretofore. In this you see that you are constantly becoming Turks to your own subjects. “Nay, you even take up the case of Luther and discuss, in the devil’s name, whether one can eat meat in the fast-times and nuns can take husbands, and things of that kind, which are not committed to you for discussion and about which God has given you no commandment; and meanwhile the serious and strict commandment of God hangs in the smoke, the commandment by which He has appointed you protectors of poor Germany; and you become murderers, betrayers, and blood-dogs to your own good, faithful, obedient subjects, and leave them to the Turk, nay, cast them into his jaws, as a reward for the bodies and money wealth and honor that they stake on you and reach out to you.”
Little Satan doesn’t have the safety of distance, nor do we have Great Satan Air Force’s advanced fleet of bombers and fighters. America could carry out an extensive air campaign using stealth technology and huge amounts of ammunition, dropping enormous payloads that are capable of hitting targets and penetrating to depths far beyond what Little Satan’s arsenal can achieve. This gives America more time than Little Satan in determining when the moment of decision has finally been reached. And as that moment draws closer, differing timetables are becoming a source of tension. in determining when the moment of decision has finally been reached. And as that moment draws closer, differing timetables are becoming a source of tension. Asking Little Satan’s leaders to abide by America’s timetable, and hence allowing Little Satan’s window of opportunity to be closed, is to make Washington a de facto proxy for Little Satan’s security — a tremendous leap of faith for Little Satan faced with a looming Iranian bomb. It doesn’t help when American officials warn Little Satan against acting without clarifying what Great Satan intends to do once its own red lines are crossed. What is needed is an ironclad American assurance that if refrains from acting in its own window of opportunity — and all other options have failed to halt Tehran’s nuclear quest — Washington will act to prevent a nuclear Iran while it is still within its power to do so.
Sometimes a mother just knows, I guess.
Because roads in most places are free at the point of usage, there is little financial incentive for drivers not to over-use them, up to the point where traffic collapses into a jam, when demand becomes limited by opportunity cost. Privatization of highways and road pricing have both been proposed as measures that may reduce congestion through economic incentives and disincentives.
It’s still a strong 10p performer for CBS. Despite what many speculate, I don’t see it going to Friday because it still pulls really good numbers on a weeknight. The only places for it are Tue and Sun and since I think CBS might try something new on Tue, that leaves Sun. If The Good Wife moves to Friday, The Mentalist goes to 10p Sun and a new drama gets the shot between that and TAR (or vice versa). I could also see The Mentalist 9p Sun followed by The Good Wife. I just think CBS might want to try to launch another new drama and Sun seems a good place. I could see trying Sherlock Holmes drama, Elementary, before or after The Mentalist.

I sprinted to the janitor's closet. Sprinted might be too strong a word since I was huffing and staggering and begging for mercy by the time I got halfway there. The closet door hung open. I peered inside the small space and grimaced at the chemical fumes stinging my nose. A metal shelf held several containers of various cleansers. I supposed if Nathan needed a chemical bath, any of them would be perfect but they wouldn't do much good in a fight. I spotted the only serviceable weapon: a broom. It was a far cry from what the Lady of the Lake offered King Arthur, but I didn't have much of a choice. I grabbed it.

What I found seemed to echo itself with every personal account of every poor mother that I came across. We are made to feel ashamed of ourselves. Because of that, we often hide the fact that we are on welfare from other people. Social workers have numerously made all of us cry tears of frustration at one point or another.
The thing is people we all live together in this world, why do we feel the need to steal from others who make a little more? Why do we feel the need to cut others down because they are “different” from you? Why? Why? Why? We are just really hurting ourselves the way we hurt others. By stealing you hurt your community, by killing you hurt the population, by bullying people, you make the world bitter. Why would you want to do that?

This past week I've been working on a sermon from Psalm 16, a beautiful golden jewel of a psalm. Some commentaries argue that the crux of the psalm is in verse 8, where it says, "I have set the Lord always before me, because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken." I've been pondering what it means to mindfully keep the Lord day by day in the very center of our lives, indeed, of our very souls. What it might look like for me.

Independence Brewing Co. was founded in Austin in 2004 by Amy and Rob Cartwright. Over the years the microbrewery has become a staple in Austin bars, restaurants and grocery stores. Independence has developed a repertoire of favorite craft beers available year-round in bottles, from the easy-drinking Austin Amber to the dark, rich and roasty Convict Hill Stout. The more adventurous fans seek out seasonal draft-only brews like the ESB and the limited Brewluminati series.

This, of course, is nuts. It's nutty, conspiratorial, fringe thinking -- it's not birtherism, but it's exactly as crazy as birtherism. Taken to its logical conclusion, it would define just about every president of the past century as a traitor to the Constitution.

The Albany Patch reported the Occupy response:
I braced myself for something sickening sweet, but the blueberry flavor was really restrained, with only the barest of sweetness and provided a great accent to the light ale. Subtlety and balance in a light refreshing ale is an underrated thing of brewing beauty, and if you asked me, Main Street nailed it. Sometimes beer works in mysterious ways and this odd looking concoction was exactly the beer I needed to regenerate before continuing our journey south.

I have seen all or parts of this film hundreds of times and it still brings a smile to my face every time I watch it.
Actually I can't really remember what happened during these past few months, but I bet it was overwhelming. But what I do remember is that I've stopped posting with my last post....the one before this one. The one called "Spaced Out", which (come to think of it) was very well received and absolutely everybody liked it. Thus, unfortunately for you, my readers, I'll abandon this path of education because it was truly hard to follow and quite boring; however, in this new post, we'll talk about statistics! Because we all know how fun they are!

Both Sushi-cyu and Patio are in the All Seasons Place. All Seasons Place is an office building with some shopping mall on the lower levels and is located right next to Conrad Hotel, where we stayed for the first 4 nights. My Japanese friend recommended Sush-cyu for Japanese food. It was simply very convenient. I thought that the Japanese food at Sushi-cyu was quite authentic. However, it was quite expensive for our wallet probably because of the location being in the heart of business district. I imagine this place being more for business people to have business dinner.

This got me thinking to what it is about me that wanted to fit the whole gay stereotype, actually no, I didn't fit the whole gay stereotype, I'd be lying if I didn't share a big amount of who I am from my mum; and how most of my characteristics are extremely feminine, I'm pretty sure this, whoever I am, isn't entirely my fault. Nor is being extremely gay, gay, or just having any sign of femininity in yourself is a bad thing.

Michigan's median household income is $48,432. If the government would have just taken money from people and then showered it randomly on households, it could have provided or saved jobs for an additional 38,173 people- but rather than do this, the government inefficiently wasted money through a pork and waste filled inefficient scheme that transferred wealth from productive and efficient members of society to corrupt and politically-connected members of society, using funds borrowed from China that we all have to now pay interest on, further lowering our future prosperity and happiness.

Misogynists make blanket assessments of women all the time because of the actions of a few or their personal prejudices against women. The existence of sexism against women does not justify the existence or necessity of misandry – sexism against men- which is laughed at as if it’s inconsequential, minor or non-existent.
Those of you who know me personally know that I dubiously started a exercise program recently on the recommendation of a friend. She knew what she was talking about. I am now officially hooked. That said, I am continually frustrated by my lack of strength, agility, endurance, etc. Last night's workout called for the building of certain new skills that I found particularly challenging. After it was over, I forced myself to work for a few minutes on a different skill which I also am struggling to develop: a box jump of a certain height.

This is part of my writing wall. I have laminated construction paper stapled to the wall with each kid's picture on a star on the corner. I put two paper clips on the top of each sheet of paper to hold their projects. Each time we have a new published piece of writing, I replace their work. It's quick and easy to switch out, and I fold their papers in half and file them away for the end of the year. At the end of the year, I will bind all of their writing together to make a book and put their star pictures on the front. These are from our Valentine's Day writing activity where I had a variety of different hearts and they could create anything they wanted with them. They're so cute, right?

According to the two senior administration officials who briefed reporters, Obama hasn’t made any decisions about the size of any post-2014 force.

Once all the tufting is done, you'll just need to finish off the edges. Don't just roll the fabric back behind the pegboard and staple it down. The key to nice looking upholstery projects is all in the lines. Minimize the bumps and wrinkles! The fabric, especially along the edges should be flat and smooth. To make the edges of a headboard smooth, fold in a line going straight out from each tuft toward the perimeter. The fold takes care of all the excess fabric so that the edges can be smooth and taut and ready for you to staple down on the back side.
I chose this image to illustrate this line because I wanted to make it as personal as possible. This is one of my senior pictures, taken last year on one of the many dirt roads in my town.

It's not a bad book. I enjoyed it mostly. I really like the characters, Ivy June and Catherine. They were likable, funny, and honest. I enjoyed reading about life in the eastern Kentucky mountains. What I didn't realize is that this book has a lot of coal mining in it. You see Ivy June's "Pappaw" is a coal miner, and that's fine. My husband is a coal miner. We are proud of coal miners!
“Unfortunately with the growth and the size the company has gotten to, the alarms are going off to where we have to figure it out or do something else,” Bell said. “I don’t want to sell, but it’s a great time to sell if I had to. There are many willing buyers. "If it was just a family business, there would be legal maneuvers we could make that would facilitate that kind of transfer across generations. With its current structure, I'm not able to do those sorts of things. It would basically leave us in the position of selling the company upon my death." He states later:
Unfortunately, that’s just not the case. Because if we don’t have an account of the origin of sin we will end up making God the author of evil—a thesis that has been persistently and strenuously rejected by the orthodox Christian tradition. Enns thinks he can save the Gospel by simply affirming universal human sinfulness without taking a stand on the origin of sin; but that is to fail to recognize that what’s at stake is the goodness of God. If God uses evolutionary processes to create the world andsin is inherent in those processes, then creation is synonymous with fall and God is made the author of sin—which compromises the very goodness of God. And if the goodness of God isn’t central to the Gospel, I don’t know what is. I don’t deny that this is an incredibly thorny issue; and this is not necessarily an apologetic for a “blow-by-blow” understanding of the Fall. I only point out that Enns’ account doesn’t recognize it as an issue. And that is a problem. Indeed, I think it explains why so much of the recent debate about the historical Adam has been an adventure in talking past one another—and why we need a new conversation to delve further into these issues, working with what Hays calls an “ecclesiocentric” hermeneutic rooted in the worship practices of the church.

I’ve never worked out to “look good” for a guy (trying to impress a new one, or fear of losing one); I always do it for myself. But the right guy appreciating it? That’s a great feeling and added bonus. You gotta give your man something to brag about haha Don’t you want him to be proud and point you out to his boys, like “yeah, that’s all me.” Or for his boys to compliment him on how good you look? Or all the while, even if no one says it (bc you don’t need recognition), you just kinda have that secret confidence on the inside?? I know I do. I don’t try to look better than anyone in the office, but I feel much better when I’ve been working out & really feel like I can take on the list of tasks thrown at me in the office. So even if I’m not utilizing my physical strength in the office…it still helps somehow. (Should I list how much I can bench and squat on my resume next to Excel skills? No? ok.)

Training Test 1, I thought some of our best trots were in this test. I carried a dressage whip with me. I didn't have spurs on either. So I knew if I just had the whip in my hand that'd perk her up just a little bit. I still didn't want to mess with her cause she is just so tolerant of everything all day. And if I would have so much as lightly tapped her with the dressage whip she'd be running from it the whole test.
But there is one stratum which is thriving better than before: the lumpenproletariat. Engaged in all kinds of informal/illegal/semi- legal trades and activities including collection of illegal levies, the overwhelming majority of them lump together to constitute the base of the ubiquitous TMC networks comparable to Bonaparte’s Society of December 10. In many places these elements are organised as “syndicates” – local cartels of order suppliers dealing with building materials, or of transport operators and so on. Even behind the midnight assault and unwarranted arrest of Prof Mahapatra of JU was the long hand of the local “syndicate”. Its leaders actually utilised the cartoon mail forwarded by the professor to punish and pressure him over some disputed bills pending with the housing complex committee (of which Prof Mahapatra is an office bearer).

Instead of just pasting in the url for this graph, Goddard downloaded the data and recreated a graph without inconveniently trending trendlines.

The event was held at a high school cafeteria. While the leftover clothes were going to a local shelter, monetary donations were being collected for the high school’s debate team. Girl members of the team were there helping out and were also participating in the swap.

In 1964 around 65,000 children were born outside marriage in Britain. In 2005 the figure was around 275,000 – and every year 50,000 UK children have the father’s name left blank on their birth certificate.

I think I only bought the Indus because it was in a four-for-a-tenner deal in my local branch of The Beer Club and what I was really after was the brewery's old ale Old Dan. Dan had a tough act to follow. I was expecting something much darker than this red-amber beer, which proved quite gold around the edges and topped by a pale beige head. The first sniff gave me boozy sherry or calvados and the taste is pure fruitcake: plums, raisins, cherries and a great big glug of alcohol. More than 33cl would be hard to take, I reckon: the flavours and the thick syrupy texture build up on each other until it starts to get quite cloying. As an after dinner liqueur substitute, shared perhaps, it's wonderful.

It revealed that given the current context of myself in that moment, the only reference points I had to process “Equal Money” were based on my already accepted beliefs, ideas, perceptions and thus, I rejected it. I classified it in the “Money Category” which in itself in the context of how I had/have constructed/designed my belief system was classified under “Not-Relevant”. Thus anything to do with Money was “Not Relevant”
Spirit: This has to do with your sense of purpose, values, beliefs, and personal vision. All the different “why’s”. Why do you do what you’re doing? Why is it important?
Now, on to the challenge for this week.
I chose to confide in many other people along the way as the decision to divorce was made final. My sister and I just aren’t that close. We talk maybe once a month and its always very top line. I just don’t choose her to vent or tell my shit. I have others for that. She was upset because she has chosen to turn to me in the past about her biggest problems. I admit I didn’t consider that at the time we got angry with each other when I told her about the divorce. I shocked her and she was upset about that, but in hindsight more so that I didn’t choose her to confide in during the tough times. Understandable I guess. But I have way more friends and support vehicles than she does. She gets that now.
The band and I played the jigs TWICE during our performance at Riverfront Park last week, just to drive the point home. Unfortunately, I think my protest was mostly ignored by the media and the North Mankato City Council. OK, it was totally ignored. Actually, they had no idea it ever happened.
Its been two weeks since I did a WIP Wednesday, Last week I just missed it and WIP Thursday just didn't have the same ring to it.

As this is not likely to be resolved in the near future I have no recourse but to remove myself and my family from the house that myself and my father before me have been living since the 1970’s – and find rented property where we will not be drowned like rats.
What we find impossible, God does not. What we see as a massive chicane, God sees as an open road. What we cannot handle, God can. He’s talking here about rich and poor. The rich, he says, do not have a shot according to man’s ways and means and thoughts. Kingdom values are upside down: last are first, first are last. Who can make sense of it?
This is the mentality of the devil himself for we see in Isaiah 14:14 Satan said, “I will be like the most high.” This is the mentality of the Antichrist for so we read of him in 2 Thessalonians 2:4. “Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.”

After the French Revolution and the overthrow of Louis XVI, most whites in San Domingo expected to receive more say in running the colony. This hope turned to terror as they learned of the new regime’s revolutionary racial plans. In 1788 a French pamphleteer named Jacques Brissot had formed the Amis des Noirs (Friends of the Blacks). Patterned after English abolitionist groups, the society soon became far more radical. Most of the future Jacobin leaders such as Lafayette, Condorcet, Mirabeau and Robbespierre were members, and chapters soon spread throughout France. San Domingo was subject to French rule, and colonists began to wonder how far these zealots would take their slogan “Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.”In the words of Mirabeau, whites “slept on the edge of Vesuvius”
The preschool wing is locked. You have to have a special magnetic door pass to get in. We don't have that. As guests, you aren't given special magnetic door passes. As I ran, I wondered how hard it would be to break down the doors. It would add a good 30 seconds to my trip if I had to make it all the way to the front of the preschool wing instead of going in on the side where her room is.

Big loans are contracted to build projects like presidential palaces enjoyed only by the politicians and the poor are made to pay for it. Like the slavery of old, the politicians, their families, the businessmen and the well connected are not hurt by the storm of poverty in Africa. Despite receiving hundreds of billions of dollars in loans and grants from Europe, Japan, US, IMF and World Bank there is nothing to show for it as poverty continue to swallow the people. The reason is that these loans and grants do not see the light, they are stolen the very day they are released and the poor people are paying for it. This explains why many countries have applied for the HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor Countries) initiative. These corrupt Slave Masters and their associates are holding the people captive with their short sighted, ill-conceived, vote buying, and cosmetic economic policies and programmes thereby giving the people no chance to develop.
There is a subtext to the show, however, and with the added context of the gallery setting, the show becomes another enterprise entirely. The fact is you don’t exactly know where to stand in Attoe’s show? Is Attoe unapologetically blue collar, making art when he returns from the factory or the bar, and his gaggle of mullet headed kids are asleep (I use archetypes not because I believe them but because Attoe seems to). Does he believe in this way of life, does he respect it in any way?
Q: Guruji, is there rebirth?
So, the lapsed Catholic in me is chuckling as I find myself, for the second time in as many months, reviewing a book that outwardly appears to be religious in nature. The first was Beatitude by Larry Closs which, as you can see from the title, would require some explanation. Rest assured, dear reader, the book had nothing to do with the eight blessings found within the bible. I promise you.

Scientists, engineers, and like minded people will often describe things (equipment, procedures, results, etc.) in mind numbing detail. This is to ensure that there is no ambiguity in their message. They don’t say, “It was big.” They say, “It was 832.6 meters measured with a 420angstrom laser rangefinder (model SX-420A11 by LightDyne systems inc.) calibrated using the IEEE standards one day before testing took place.”
Like so many of us, I feel that almost-irresistible urge to eat, especially comfort food or high fat/high carb food, when I’m stressed, especially by family drama. I won’t name names, but I have family members who know all my buttons and who, for example, routinely take advantage of generosity to the point of my feeling used, or who respond to reasonable requests as if I’m the biggest, uh, let’s say witch, on the planet. And when feeling abused by family (or other people or situations), I respond by wanting to be kind to myself (since I’m feeling that no one else is), and typically food AND alcohol are (regrettably) still the first things that come to mind. Quick, readily available, relatively, cheap, and very effective (at least at the time of the pain).
It is said (by the wise and sage beings we refer to as ‘they’) that we make our own destiny. Turns out ‘they’ are indeed wise and sage. By simply opening my wardrobe, catching the plush look of my suede cherry-red pumps, I set out to have a foot-tappingly joyful day.
Zachariah had striking blue eyes, dark brown scruffy hair and a thin scraggly little beard. He was deeply tan and fit and wore shorts most of the time with no shirt or shoes; he carried a green canvas backpack that was always loaded with fruit and nuts that he would share with me.
If you don’t want to spend money on a dresser but you have a complicated dress/bustle make sure that you have a bridesmaid or two with you at your final fitting to learn how to get you in your dress. Do not have your mother be the one to have to get on the floor—in her dress—to get you in or to bustle your dress before the reception.
My carafe has a lovely, err, tannish tint to it these days. There are occasionally individual coffee grounds that stick to the bottom. The coffee rings that usually show up on your desktop? They’re at the bottom of my carafe. I figure brewing a pot of very hot coffee scalds away the badness (I don’t know, mold spores?) and the seasoned pot adds, umm, irony? I haven’t been covering it with aluminum foil, but I have been doing the smear-it-with-oil thing. I don’t use oil, I use Jameson, but seems to work.

In other news: a funny thing happened in Taxco today. One of the girls in our group had a ton of people ask to take a picture with her. I'm not sure why -- the only explanation I can think of is that she's African-American, and stands out from the norm. But we also had people take our picture the other day in a different town in a completely different state. Maybe taking pictures with tourists is a thing in Mexico...?
The new devotional books are AWESOME. The boy woke me up in the middle of the night, and when I finally got him back to sleep Saint wanted to go out. While Saint was out, I fell asleep at my desk–NOT comfy at all. Saint has this habit of knocking on the door by bouncing the top half of his body off of it. Yeah, let’s just say, when I woke up in a puddle of drool, I thought the sky was falling there for a second, and I was WIDE awake. I couldn’t go back to sleep after that, so I was up till like 2:30 reading and looking over the new books. Anyway back to the story. The books have a page for praise reports and this morning the girls got to write about how God heard our prayers and fixed up Saint.
I must admit, my memory is terrible. I’ve never remembered things very well. Names especially are the worse. I don’t think it’s my age, because even at the university, when I was young, I had to learn all the names of the insects and parts of their bodies, or chemicals names, formulas, you know, lots of “name stuff”! It was terrible because memorizing has never been my strength. I never did good in those tests. Oh my… I’m so glad they are over.
It does concern me though, that there are many warped perceptions in the world today concerning South Africa’s past. One of the mistaken beliefs is that the conflict in the country was dominated by rivalry between Black and White races only. Another misconception is that the indigenous Africans were the only people who suffered hardship, pain, and sorrow. This chronicle will reveal that, although there is some degree of truth in these perceptions, the current worldview is excessively unbalanced and unjust regarding this issue.
So there you have them. Sequels that should never have been made, let alone watched, let alone shown, let alone considered entertainment. Oh there's more to be sure, and I may get to more of them someday, but for now, I need to lie down; that was a lot of pain to recall in one posting.

The point I was originally trying to make is that if you've read all my shit, you've clearly read this post. And if you've read that, you clearly remember two characters I introduced in that post: Alice and Fuckle.
“And so you shall, my dear sir!” his visitor exclaimed. “Owing to the war, I’m living at present in rooms in Bloomsbury. I can’t afford to keep up my house in Wales, and I want to be near my little girl, who is working at the Ministry of Munitions. But I’m too fond of the picture to part with it even for a time. It’s my especial pride. I can’t think how you can keep these glowing canvases unhung. You must look me up and give me your honest opinion. I’m only sorry I can’t show you my collection; but that will have to wait. Meantime, look me up at 33, Patmore Street, Bloomsbury. I find it so handy, you know, for the Museum. One thing only I would beg – a clear twenty-four hours’ notice. I am a martyr to asthma, and during an attack I find it impossible to see any one. As to the hour, my mornings and afternoons are usually occupied, but any evening, Mr. Digby, when you’re in town, I should be delighted to see you.”
I’m not sure when a pond turns into a lake but this was quite a big pond, completely enclosed and artificially created I’m sure. It’s main attraction were the pipes that had been tipped there, big concrete affairs, wide enough to walk through and shelter in when it was pouring down, that tumbled down a steep slope and ended somewhere underwater. Who knows, perhaps there were more underwater than above it. Some kids would drag a pallet and a couple of oil drums from the local industrial estate and construct a raft but I was far too afraid of water at that age to suggest or agree to anything so reckless; I didn’t learn to swim until I was a teenager and I wouldn’t call myself a good swimmer now but I could probably save my own life.

This boy's mom did everything right. She sent her child to a peanut-free classroom. She went in and approved the snacks that were safe for him. Still, while eating a snack and watching a movie in his classroom, he ate peanuts. Another child had a peanut butter granola bar and it somehow ended up on this boy's plate. In the dark, he reached for it and took a small bite.

He said the media had given a different impression about the MLAs to the people. “Is that what all MLAs do? If someone, knowingly or unknowingly does it, it’s fine to write about it for a day or two,’’ he said. He advised the media to use some restraint. “The speaker has constituted a committee to probe the incident. Even after this, the media seeks my reaction on the issue daily,’’ he fumed.

Josh Beckett is one of the most talented pitchers of the last fifty years. You could probably go back a hundred years. Beckett was the second pick of the 1999 amateur draft, behind Josh Hamilton, who is of course one of the most talented hitters of the last 50 years. Beckett is 6-foot-5, and in his best days he threw a 100-mile-per-hour fastball, a mind-bending curve and a pretty decent change-up that seemed like piling on. He could, at his best, throw all these pitches for strikes with regularity, and he could strike out big league batters with any of those pitches. In his first full year in the minors, he struck out 203 in 140 innings, walked just 34, went 14-1 with a 1.54 ERA. He was otherworldly.

"What I personally love about my job, is the freedom I have. I get to dress however I want, do my make-up however I want, and style my hair however I want. I get to dance all night and I talk to people who I would have never met on a regular basis. I get to make up new drinks and have my customers taste them (most love my lil concoctions). I work at night only a few nights a week and that is enough for me to pay all my bills and then some. I get to be invited to some pretty kick ass events... I could go on and on about all the perks. But what I really motivates me IS seeing people smile. I know, I know, It sounds soooo cheesy, but I know my role in your day. You come to the club for a release of everyday life. You want to escape from your constant reality and get lost in a moment. And as a bartender, all I can hope is that I want to be a positive experience for you. That's why I dance and sing all night. That is why you will always see me smiling or laughing. That's why I start up conversations with strangers at my bar. That is why I always want say Hi to everyone that I recognize. That is why I do some cornball, goofy thing when I know your watching me... To make you smile. I like to think this is my small contribution to the world right now :)"

In all cases, though, these books offer further evidence of an irresistible popular urge to discuss the future, and to do so through what can very broadly described as fiction. The recent speculative tone taken by much of today's architecture writing is only part of this trend; from "design fiction" to speculative foreign policy blogs, and from "the world without us" to future food, a compulsion to understand what might happen to human civilization, in both the near and distant future, using fictional scenarios and speculative hypotheses seems to be at a high point of trans-disciplinary appeal.
As I've written before, Ryancare substitutes ideology for honesty. Brooks sips from this cup of Kool-Aid regularly, rarely if ever pointing out that Ryancare is all in on controlling costs by shifting them to elders. If that's what the country wants, then it's what we should do. But how about being up front about the choice?

But anyways, here we are with posher more sophisticated Carling. Similar to Foster’s Gold it is a lighter tasting lager with more alcohol. Is more closely resembles a “Lite” beer, whilst Foster’s Gold tasted much more like the “ice” beers that hit the market a few years back. The beer is smooth with a sweetish aftertaste and arguably has more going for it than Foster’s Gold. I found it a nicer drink than the previous one. Neither really would appeal to the drinker looking for beery flavour but both are nice easy going bottles of cold beer to get pissed up on. I’d neck it any day of the week. I’m often perplexed when I read more scathing reviews of light lager among beer geeks. Sure beer geeks are looking for more by way of beery taste, but there is nothing wrong or unpleasant about necking lighter beer.
In May 2005, the Central Bank published its ‘Fit and Proper’ Guideline (sic) and that document can be found at http://www.central-bank.org.tt/news/releases/2005/mr050510.pdf.

There are good arguments for and against reforming the upper chamber. Many are opposed to the very principle of an unelected House of Parliament – a practice present in only 15 other countries worldwide. Others are concerned that an elected second house would result in US senate-style gridlock, and highlight the good – if mostly invisible – work of peers like Jane Campell and Dee Doocey in opposing the Government’s regressive welfare and legal aid cuts. Some like Polly Toynbee have called for the abolition of the House altogether.
I mean how hard can it be to find and employ economics correspondents who know a thing or two about Wales and my other thought is whether there an appetite or room for a Welsh focused publication like the Economist or the Financial Times that would really help with reporting and understanding of recent events.

Chuck’s family tree is getting more complicated than the ones on Game of Thrones! The poor guy is still trying to make sense of this mess so he enlists Blair’s help to crack the code in Diana’s book. Of course, she can because she is Blair Waldorf after all! Which leads them (the gang is back together btw! awesome!) to the brothel, where Chuck confronts Jack. Jack is still being dense about everything, until Blair goes to talk to him after making her discovery. He makes her promise not to say anything to Chuck but of course she does, I mean Chuck has been through enough methinks. So, after a teary conversation with Blair, Chuck goes back inside when everyone is gone and…BART IS ALIVE! What? How? That was truly an OMG moment!

Honestly, the first thing that struck me at this stop was the beautiful log home. And the dark slate everywhere. The slate was used for the house, the paths and the walls, and provided a nice dark background for all the color. You could really tell that this is an older garden. Plants have really made their own way. Very natural and unmanicured, peaceful and wandering. There are Forget-Me-Nots woven amongst most everything and they really added a nice, whimsical Alaskan touch. I got the sense of a "tamed" meadow.

Use this 5 steps daily in your business or career and others may one day come pay to hear you SPEAK.
If the goal is highly complex, special care is needed to ensure that the work/effort doesn’t become too overwhelming. The goal setter needs sufficient time to meet the goal but also enough time to practice or learn what is expected and required for its success. Be patient with yourself and reward each small success until you are ready to move onto the next. By summer’s end I had succeeded in hiking more than 6 hikes by my criteria. However, when the group decided on one hike to go an additional distance and climb higher, I knew I wasn’t ready and so stayed behind with a few others who all knew they were not ready to go further. Although I had succeeded in achieving my original goals I needed more time to train my body, my mind and my endurance level before taking on new goals and hiking to a higher level. The next summer, I successfully set out a new plan of action to hike at an intermediate level. Success eventually came where I could climb 1000 meter plus, at 10k plus distance with no problem.

And the actors at least do a good-enough job. Our drifting anti-hero Derr (whose name unfortunately sounds like it should be followed by derp but anyway) was actually an honest-to-goodness actor who found his way into a couple of Charlie Chan films, then graduated to such works as the George Stevens film Something To Live For, headlined that end-of-the-world epic When Worlds Collide, not to mention starring as Lamont Cranston (yes, The Shadow) in The Invisible Avenger, and also featured in such classics as Paul Newman thriller The Drowning Pool, Richard Gere sex-em-up American Gigolo and Clint Eastwood Commie shoot-em-up Firefox. He at least shows himself as able to emote well under the circumstances, smoking, sweating, sexing and slugging as called upon.
So how do you swiftly end the evening without turning your hands into a scabby mess that will screw up your chances of actually going out with someone decent?
Already 35 (and a half), and still self-conscious? Unfortunately, yes. I also pray for myself, to move from this self-centered and self-conscious frame of mind, into a place of genunine peace with who I am, not who I'm becoming, not who I was, but who and where I am right now. A place where doing laundry, picking up toys, wiping noses, fixing lunches, and then doing it all again the next day doesn't feel awkward. A place where I'm happy with myself and the plan that God has for me. Right now.

The contrast between esoteric spirituality and religious fundamentalism reminds me of the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. One is content with conscious intimacy and embracing the mystery of life, whereas the other is preoccupied with unconscious possession and striving to define and ultimately limit the infinite divine in their own creed. Perhaps every person needs to choose between these two trees or two systems of thought or belief within themselves. Our true divine self or Christ consciousness, so to speak, beckons us to listen to the still, small voice concerning the mystery of who we are. May we continue to be still and know I Am.
The key to entering into silence and solitude begins with a willingness to abandon all distractions. Silence and solitude are an invitation to search and explore both the outward and inward dynamics of our hearts that we work so hard to ignore. Embarking on this journey requires quieting the mind and body and adopting an external awareness of what affects the five senses. Ask yourself:
I only had to do about 140 km today, which isn't that much, but of course I couldn't even find my way out of Oslo properly. I blame it on the roadworks and the rain clouds, which prevented me from seeing the sun and any shadows, which in turn prevented me from knowing what direction I was heading in. I found my way out in the end though, not to worry. When I finally got out of Oslo, the roads were actually pretty decent.

The pacing of BLACK SPOT seems designed for a classic Russell T Davies run and shout episode, but there’s no room for anyone to run anywhere – even the deck seems small and cramped. There’s a line where the Doctor is on the plank and he wonders aloud, “Where’s the rest of your crew?” but my immediate response was to ask back, “Where would you put them?” When Amy dons her pirate gear to save the Doctor and starts swinging around, it looks like she’s swinging just far enough to need to hold on to the ropes.
It was the most extraordinary of statements. Aldous was enormously impressed by it, and also very touched and amused. Of course he understood it. But I must have looked bewildered, for Krishnamurti, in a softer, calmer way, said, “It just happens, do you see?” Alas, I did not see very well. Krishnamurti continued, “I am not a healer, or a psychologist, or therapist, or any of those things.” The words “healer,” “psychologist,” “therapist” burst from him like projectiles ejected by compressed power. “I am only a religious man. Alcoholics or neurotics or addicts— it doesn’t matter what the trouble is— they get better quite often— but that is not important; that is not the point— it is only a consequence.”

When the Gala ended (way too early), I went with Luciana to Food Fight for Upton's pop up sandwich shop. I had the second best sandwich of my life there: chicken seitan, grilled eggplant, chipotle aioli on a delightful focaccia. So good! Then this lady randomly pulls up in an ice cream truck and offers us samples of coconut lemon saffron ice cream. BEST. THING. EVER. And the weird thing is that she had never, ever stopped her truck there before. This is why I love Portland.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt, sugar, vanilla and butter, beating until your batter is nice and smooth. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium to high heat. Pour or scoop (whatever you find easiest) the batter onto the griddle or pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Make sure to tilt the griddle/pan with a circular motion so that the batter coast the surface evenly. Cook each crepe for about two minutes per side, or until lightly browned.
Ok final question now. What’s your favourite sight, sound, smell and feeling?

We started just a little after 8:30, I think, but close. The gate narrowed us down a little, but the field wasn’t huge so we all got out quick. I took off too fast, but tried to hold it as far as I could. I had to back off at about 3/4 of a mile. I could still hold a good pace, but it was slower. We went down a long hill on Kinwest Parkway right off the bat. This looked like it would be our “demon” coming back up for the finish. We turned a corner onto a side street at about a mile out. By then we were at our second water stop. I didn’t stop at this one and at the first, I barely slowed down. I got a little bit in me and some on me. I still haven’t’ figured out how to drink and run; just not that coordinated.
I was looking forward to this film based purely on the fact that it is directed by the bravest film maker around in Gasper Noe (Irreversible).

So while it no longer makes sense to be short bonds (as Gross has figured out the hard way), what makes sense is to be very, very long duration, since this is what the Fed will be buying in Operation Twist/Torque. Enter Exhibit A – the chart of maturity/distribution of PIMCO holdings, of which most notable is the explosion in average holding duration, which from 4.56 in July, has soared to 6.27 in August, the highest since 6.23 in October, and possibly the highest on record (that said our records only go back to 2007). As part of this expansion, Gross has seen his Mortgage Securities soar to $78.5 billion, the highest since February, when Gross was actively reducing his MBS holding profile, and now is doing the opposite, and is accumulating Agency paper hand over fist in an attempt to extend duration. Bottom line: Pimco is now balls to the wall in the QE3 camp, first to be manifested by Operation Twist, and then, likely by outright Large Scale Asset Purchases. Look for numerous other copycat investors to expand the duration of their fixed income holdings from 4-5 to over 6.

“These children are the innocent bystanders of the global war on AIDS, which is destroying the social fabric in sub-Saharan Africa. For decades, the virus festered in the region while the world stood by paralyzed with indifference. Meanwhile, the numbers grew to epic proportions, becoming a human catastrophe unprecedented in history. Today, two-thirds of the world’s people living with HIV – an estimated 22 million adults and children – live in sub-Saharan Africa, only a fraction of them benefiting from the expensive, life giving drugs that have made AIDS a manageable disease in the West.”

I try to “write” for at least two hours several days a week. This does not include time spent in doing research, brain storming, reading writing related blogs etc. There are times when I write for much longer, it happens when I am in the thick of a project and the ideas and words are flowing especially freely. I wish I was more disciplined about writing schedules, but life can get in the way.
Sangeeta went missing on April 20 after she left her husband’s home in Ulhasnagar for work. When she did not return, her family lodged a missing complaint with the Hill Line police on April 21. The same day, Sangeeta’s body was found near the railway tracks between Vangani and Badlapur stations in the jurisdiction of the Badlapur East police. Unaware of the missing complaint lodged at the Hill Line police station, the Badlapur police sent the body to the mortuary of Central Hospital in Ulhasnagar. The fact that the victim’s face was severely damaged and no document was found on her body made it difficult for the police to establish her identity.

When it comes to making my own salsas at home, I've often limited myself to making the usual salsas that involve fresh tomatoes, fresh jalapenos, an onion, some cilantro and a bit of lime juice... or pico de gallo. And from time to time, I may make the salsa verde, guacamole, or the black bean and corn salsa.... even the quick, budget-friendly avocado sauce. They are all excellent. But recently I managed to make 2 different salsas, opening the door to a new way of making salsa for me... using various chiles to add depth and flavor.

In short, it is inconceivable how the Formula One authorities can proceed with the race in Bahrain given the current circumstances. In addition to the increasingly escalating security situation, with security forces cracking down on peaceful protesters with excessive force on a daily basis, proceeding with the race would send the wrong political signal. The authorities in Bahrain desperately want to present an image to the outside world that stability has been restored, and necessary measures to improve human rights have been fully enacted. By moving forward with the race, Formula One becomes complicit in the regime’s bad behavior by giving it a cover of legitimacy that accepts a model of stability through repressive force.

It sounds funny, but one of the best things that could ever happen to me was when I lost my faith for a few years. The devil attacked me in a way I didn’t know he could, and he was so clever at it that I didn’t even know it was him doing it, and it began a chain-reaction that led me to turn my back on God. It took several years before I acknowledged there was a Powerful Source that must have created everything. It only made sense. We did not “evolve” from apes or tadpoles or any other created being. Someone had to create those other beings and Someone had to create me. So I began to address that Someone. Eventually my searching began in earnest for the Truth. I went down many wrong roads and got into some spiritually dangerous and frightening situations until I literally had the hell scared off of me, turned around and ran back to God. He was waiting right behind me the whole time, with His arms stretched out wide to receive me!! I was back where I belonged!! Then I began searching in the right place. Having burned all my bibles, commentaries, dictionaries and notes I was given an unused Bible by a friend. I sat down and said, “God, I need You to show me Who You are. Not what I’ve been taught, but Who You truly are.” I was addressing, my Abba, God the Father. I read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation and then I knew Who God the Father was. By then, my belief in Jesus had returned. Once again, I sat down and said, “Jesus, I need You to show me Who You are. I don’t need to learn ‘stories’ about You. I need to know the real You.” I reread the Bible front to back. Then I realized I never truly knew Who the Holy Spirit was. So I turned to Him next and said, “Holy Spirit, please tell me Who You are. I really don’t know!!” Once more I read the entire Bible. When I was finished, I discovered that I had really only just begun. Now that I knew Who God was from the words of the Scriptures written by the Holy Spirit, God was going to begin to show me day by day on what has been a long, hard, terrifying, blessed, blissful, excruciatingly painful, wondrous, amazing, tear-filled, heart-broken, stronger-than-ever-before odyssey that has led me to the best place I’ve ever been in my entire life. A place of such intimacy with Jesus that I never knew existed. A place of such satisfying contentment that I never thought I’d find here on earth. A place of such peace and calmness that I’d only glimpsed on occasion and tasted pieces of that left me longing for more and more, yet was so elusive to my desperate grasp. A place that every human being who has ever been born, is being born right this second and who will be born in the future is longing for with their entire being: A place where that God hole is filled up to overflowing with the Only One Who is capable of filling that empty space up completely with Himself.
We also celebrated Kyle's 26th birthday on June 21st. I took him to a Japanese steakhouse for dinner and secretly made him a 3 tiered birthday cake while he was sleeping. He was pleasantly surprised for everything. We truly didn't have the money to go out for dinner, but we have made the decision that we need to at least do something nice for each of our birthdays....even if that means adding a higher balance to the credit card. We also had our 2nd wedding anniversary (we've been married for 3.5 years but waited a year and a half to do the actual wedding) on June 27th. We didn't do anything for it other than make dinner together. We made chicken manicotti at home and watched tv together. We are such the "old couple" now! ha ha.

In waiting for the return of The Walking Dead series to AMC, I was watching that ridiculous trailer for Battle Ship and wondered which would be more likely in a fantasy scenario.
I still love cooking, baking and making photo's, but there are some realities as well to be faced. We're in situation of economy crisis in Belgium,, ie. the price of gas & electricity go so high (too high), the price of gasoline is 30% up in 2 months time, and off course, not to mention the prices of (fresh)food go along with others, but the salary stays the same. Now we're trying to cut the expenses by lowing the use of electricity & car. So here I am with less cooking and baking, and also less going around with the car.

The first step in this process is to notice how the difficult places in our lives have affected us---at the heart level. Next, we need to identify each person, circumstance, or event that hurt us or broken our hearts. Then we need to put words to our pain.

This isn't exactly a comedy sketch, but A.) this list wouldn't feel right without it; and B.) it's one of cinema's greatest non sequiturs courtesy of one of history's finest sketch groups. The scene begins with Roman legionnaires chasing would-be messiah Brian up a parapet, segues into a minute or so of intergalactic insanity, and ends. That's what I love about Monty Python films - they're always keen to blow thousands of dollars on fantastically pointless scenes.

i go from the delusion that everything is going to be a-ok,
I had a lot of fun doing all that research. Because I had a solid theme this year--unlike in 2011--I could plan ahead and had everything scheduled by the end of April 1. It took a big load off blogging for the rest of the month, since all I had to do was edit the posts the day before and comment. I wouldn't necessarily recommend scheduling ahead of time for everyone's style is different, but for relatively factual and static post subjects, I think it works. Scheduling has greatly caught on with me, actually, because I get the impulse to do it with all of my posts now.

While the Steve was walking down the hall, keeping the numbers in his memory, another staff member would “coincidentally” appear in the hallway holding a tray of dessert. This staff member said to Steve, “Oh, you’re participating in our study? Thank you so much! You know we just ended a big meeting and have all of these leftover snacks. Can I offer you some fruit or a piece of cake?” Professor Shiv then compiled the choices of each participant. Who chose the fruit? Who chose the cake?

A fine old time was had last Wednesday night at the Hodges Figgis ‘Crime Night’, and very nice it was to meet with some familiar names, and put faces to said names. It was a tidy turn-out, too, and I sincerely hope that everyone who turned up enjoyed it as much as I did. Most enjoyable, perhaps, was the fact that the evening’s moderator, Professor Ian Campbell-Ross, declared yours truly the ‘senior member’ of a panel that included Arlene Hunt and Conor Brady, which was the first and very probably the last time I’ll be referred to as such in the presence of an ex-Irish Times editor.
Writers: such services are not a good use of your money. Bookstores (or libraries, or newspapers, or book reviewers, or whatever demographic the service claims to access for you) do not pay attention to spam solicitations. The catalog (assuming it's actually mailed) or email (assuming it gets past the recipient's spam filter) will probably be trashed. At most it may be glanced at. The odds of anyone paying any attention to your book as a result of mass-mail-style promotions are vanishingly small.

It was no so good for Thokk, who had to charge in next and bang on the wall where Poppy located the door in an effort to unlock it, taking a bolt of energy for his work. Once this was done, Poppy had to come back in and take a hit from the bolt while she used her thieves tools to finally unlock the door. This three part act went on through 3 or 4 small rooms, until Thokk bowed out and Hex took over the athletics. Finally, after every one’s hair was on end and smoking, they opened a door that led not to another small chamber, but to another great hall much like the first. We will end the tale here, as the party finally escapes the gauntlet of doors and looks forward to the next danger, each victory bringing them one step closer to defeating the Tomb of Horrors and thus getting their lives back (or so they think…)

The story starts with Kate returning from her summer in Greece with James (otherwise known as Hermes). But things aren’t how she’d imagined them to be. There was no happy reunion with Henry (Hades) and one of the original Titans, Cronus, has started to break free from the prison that the six original gods had sentenced him to thousands of years ago. It seems that Calliope (Hera) wasn’t happy with the punishment Kate bestowed upon her last winter – and she’s out for revenge.
And, last but not least is posture. Everything you’re doing caring for your baby at the moment involves you hunching forwards eg feeding baby, lifting baby, pushing your buggy etc. Good posture in seated and in standing is essential. If you didn’t do Pilates during pregnancy and you’re concerned that your posture is worsening now that you’re no longer pregnant, I’d strongly suggest that you find a Postnatal Pilates teacher locally who can a) assess your posture and b) set you a program of pelvic and shoulder stabilisation exercises that will help tone your abdominals and pelvic floor, and get you thinking seriously about how to conduct yourself in normal day-to-day activities like lifting, carrying and feeding baby. Having good posture when it comes to exercise is essential, hence the reason I’ve mentioned it here. In my classes for new mums, I’m constantly listing teaching points eg feet hip distance, knees soft, shoulders back and down, abdominals connected etc, to ensure that my clients are in the most optimum and supportive position when they’re exercising. Because I remind them so frequently, these tips then start to transfer into their daily lives too, which can only help improve their posture, mindset and well-being. So, have a think about how you’re sitting reading this now? Are your shoulders lifted? Is your back in a supportive position?

As adults in the United States, we have a lot of choices. It's good that we have a lot of choices. It's all the choices that make me feel "safer and less anxious." Fewer choices would do the opposite for me. If you doubt that, I suggest you go to Saudi Arabia and talk to the women there about the driving situation. They do not feel "safer and less anxious" with the limit that prohibits them from driving. I just can't believe that limits on personal freedom, imposed and strictly enforced by others, make anyone (kids included) feel comfortable.
So, basically, I’ve just added two more projects to my already-crowded summer to-do list. That’s two novels to edit/rewrite, at least three cowritten projects lined up (only one of which we really intend to get done over the summer – the others can wait), and two scripts to finish. Fortunately one of them is also collaborative. The other one, though… not only does it need to be written all the way through, it’ll also need some serious revising. Oh, and I’ll have four stories of the month to do.

We’ve learned that phone calls shouldn’t be had when one of the following things are happening: there is a somethingball game on and the apartment is full of girls or children yapping in the background. We’ve also learned that being on time isn’t so difficult to manage but that being 5 minutes late isn’t so terrible either. We’ve also accepted and embraced that sometimes a scientist just doesn’t understand the thoughts of an artist, and an artist sometimes will never know what a scientist is talking about. A little over a year of being that special someone for the other, we still think we’ve got most of it figured out.

Thankfully with a little venting via my wife I was able to gain control of my emotions and the urge to eat. They stayed with me until my head hit the pillow last night but I was able pull back the reigns and avoid opening the refrigerator.

Out of all this we can make at least one assumption, which is that what we are doing isn’t working and as Albert Einstein said insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. So the question we have to answer is this: What can we do which will demonstrate our values? What we have been trying hasn’t worked. Differentiation isn’t working.
The problem with arguing with someone with a big investment in their beliefs, and it is as true of atheists as followers of any religion, is their rejection of reason. In my current argument, with a Catholic, I have been compelled to cite papal bulls to illustrate my points. Fortunately in this debate my opponent is a lot less abusive than some I have encountered.
But generally, that trail along the Iloilo floodway was a perfect metaphor of EVERYDAY BATTLES. Biking in general is a perfect metaphor.
Did you notice that I read concerning Abraham, “when he was tried” or put to the test? He passed with flying colours.

One time the med staff and I were waiting for EMS to come in with a kid who'd fallen off his skateboard and hit his head. Of course he wasn't wearing a helmet. We were just standing around when one of the Spanish translators came in saying,
Currently, the media is showing a horribly skewed picture of the real world. Fiction writers, with our limitless power to reinvent the world, to hold a mirror up to it or subvert it, are showing a horribly skewed picture of the world. If you are not white, if you are not straight, if you are not physically perfect (and to some extent, if you are one of the slightly more than 50% of the population who is female) you know how it feels to wonder why no one wants to write about people LIKE YOU for a freaking change.

Many brands have been using Pinterest to attract traffic to visit their sites. It has become a cheaper and easier form of advertising. Instead of spending an advertising budget on sidebar ads or click-through advertising, many companies, especially those featuring CPG’s, have found a more efficient way to drive traffic to their sites.
However, regardless of changing times and mores, I would still be wary of anyone who calls themselves a crook or pervert :)
All the guests wore black hooded capes, Harry Potter-esque glasses, and carried wizard wands. We wanted to create the uniform for Wiz Tech, the Wizard Academy seen in the show.

“Nay, ‘tis we who are early,” Ewan said, dismissing her apology with a wave of his hand. “Thee art most becoming in thy riding habit.”
Which roughly translated means they're Arabs and so can't get permits and because they can't get permits they can't settle and because they can't settle they are nomads and because they are nomads they can't get permits and, oh never mind.
Prime Ministerial PMQs and statements aside, probably the time has come for those in the Real Opposition to assess who will be next in the firing line across these three dangerously interwoven sectors of our public life: the media, the police, and the politicians. Somewhere in there lies the full strength of how the law has been flouted, and the Constitution perverted, by all three in various ways since around the turn of the century. But some very determined investigators are going to have to take on some very powerful interests to enjoy any real depth of success in such a thankless mission. Jailing Coulson is going to seem a fairly straightforward process by comparison.
And the preference for "the devil they know" has led to conservatives being caricaturized as wanting NO change when in fact all that they insist on is CAREFUL change. From Cromwell on, conservatives have never been characterized by a rejection of change for its own sake. When a regime is clearly oppressive or an experiment has clearly failed (such as State ownership of industry) conservatives find no difficulty in abandoning it and changing to something else.
Another factor was that over 20 years the average investor had returns of 3.83% while the index did 9.14%.
The Corn Refiners Association “has been trying to counter the bad publicity around HFCS since 2004,” but concluded it “could no longer afford to rely on simple grass-roots marketing tactics such as talking with nutritionists and doctors.”
It feels weird not having her here now. Sort of like having a child going to camp or something, I guess.
Pain is the unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage. We have all experienced pain at one time or another and it is unpleasant. But too often patients become reliant on pain medication because it helps them cope with the emotional experience of pain rather than the physical portion. Pain medication is only meant to be a temporary treatment along with traditional non-drug therapies like physical therapy, massage therapy, heat/cold therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and stimulation therapy. However, far too often these traditional therapies cause more pain or no relief and can cost far too much time and money. For example, physical therapy requires an average of 8 weeks with 9-10 visits before relief and strength returns to damaged tissue. There are alternatives treatments that can be used in addition to or instead of traditional medical practices that have the potential to bring relief and help with the emotional response of pain.

I may be a bit (I shudder to say) MIA this weekend but don’t you think I deserve what may be my first and last road trip of the year?
“Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government.” – Henry Kissinger, Bilderberger Conference in Evians, France, 1991

Potlucks and events where I have to bring a passing dish are a nightmare. I hate it. I never know what to bring. Growing up, I've always been the youngest and never had to really do any cooking or even bring a passing dish as an adult because I was the baby and I accepted my role graciously. Now that I'm older and have come into a great group of friends, I'm a it embarrassed of my lack of cooking knowledge and experience.
The person who solves the issue of poverty in India is not going to be a key tapping journalist, a politician, an NGO, an economics nobel laurete or a charitable organisation. They don’t understand the pain, and therefore they won’t understand the problem. They keep trying to transform or “raise” others into replicas of themselves. Gandhiji was one who transformed himself from a rich bania, to a man with two sets of clothes, a cobbler, a toilet cleaner, a weaver, a farmer… to become one of the people that he wanted to catalyse into helping themselves. He is an exception. That is why his solutions appealed to the masses. He felt their life, pain, problems and strengths.

It’s hard to believe that the 138th running of the Kentucky Derby is less than a week away. Last year, I was fortunate enough to tab longshot Animal Kingdom as the winner, before I stubbed my toe in the Preakness and Belmont. The year before, I swept the Triple Crown, including the cold trifecta in the Belmont Stakes. Let’s see if we can get another streak going next Saturday.

In all fairness to McCoy, he isn’t a total clownish d-bag here, and turns in a passable performance. The infamous “cliffhanger” scene aside, he does little to drag the story down, nor does he do much to elevate it. Langford is as terrible as ever. But between the two the improbable sort of happens in the final moments of “Dragonfire,” which features a weirdly offbeat yet sweetly melancholic parting scene between the duo. It was something of a last minute addition, and Ian Briggs swears it doesn’t work, and maybe it doesn’t entirely; yet the fact that something that doesn’t work still manages to be an acting highpoint of the year says a great deal about the faults of Season 24.
I think that’s all there is to report. I hadn’t actually expected to be making this post until tomorrow, but somehow I thought I had more ending to write than it turned out. Maybe that’s part of why I’m not happy with the ending, the feeling that it’s missing something. Oh well, that’s something I can mull while I’m NOT editing that beast, and then work out when it’s time to tackle the task. In the meantime, I’m off to give my brain a much needed, deserved break. I will say, though, the thrill of writing The End still hasn’t gotten old, even though I’ve done it 3 times now in fairly rapid succession. I doubt it ever will, though.

I have several libertarian leaning friends and relatives. Debates about politics and economic policy often occur. I sense a great many arguments for the curative power of unfettered capitalism are based more on dogma that fact. But, without any formal education in economics, I'm at a bit of a disadvantage.
My Thoughts:
And, as I said, that is EXCLUDING the United States. So, why in the world are we saving our oil all the time. I remember when those dumb democrats decided we didn’t need to explore and use our oil because we could use what someone else had first. Then we could save ours. Why!! Why in the world are we doing any of this. I am quite sure that we will have all the oil we could ever use in this world – ever. We don’t need to be conserving our oil or anyone else’s as far as I am concerned.

One can only hope that Brietkopf was the one who fatally shot the knife-wielder, and thus received some karma for being a douchebag. But I have a feeling that both of the cops who shot someone dead are still unfortunately alive today, and that the cop who was shot dead probably did not deserve this.

. I really had to use a lot of glue and pressure to get the green piece to stick to the gold because it was buckled from the watered down ink. Here's my trick. After glue it down well, I flip it over onto a clean piece of paper and use a clean wooden roller and roll over a few times pressing down quite hard. That is the only thing I use this wooden roller for - I picked it up at a thrift store so I have no idea what brand it is but it works great. Any hard roller would do.

Yesterday (2/9) was my one year bandiversary!! Yay. I went shopping today to celebrate. I bought some cute shirts. My band tightness that had me a little worried after my most recent fill has settled down and I'm comfortable. Quite possibly in the green zone. Only trouble is with breakfast but I'm figuring it out. I'm down to 157 lbs. I hit 156 for a few days when I was struggling with not eating much.

Hopefully these 3 posts can help map some of the conceptual business models and case studies in the social entrepreneurship space. I realize they don’t cover 100% of the field, so if you know of others feel free to leave a comment about other models for social innovation and social business in the comments section.
The sentiment, swirls and "butterfly" are from Spiral Boutique. The "butterfly" is actually one of the solid images turned upside down. I stamped it on the background and then stamped it again on scratch paper to cut out.
I also find a lot of comfort in the following quote by Ira Glass (many of you may have seen this before):
Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that will weigh survival against humanity and life against love.
I try to show goodwill and appreciation toward my doctors not just from a public relations perspective (although that does factor in), but also because I do truly appreciate what my doctors do for me. I am mindful of how far a simple verbal thank you or thank-you note goes.

Yes, yes. I know. Where have I been, you say? The answer, for the most part, is that I've been writing songs. There's more to the story than that, of course, but most of the other stuff isn't all that interesting, so we can leave it at that.
The tears roll down my cheeks.
"It's not really in me to get too wound up about it," said Nicol. "Partly because that's clearly what they want, but also because I really don't think that whatever they're up to is going to make any difference to us in the long run."

So he was doing some stuff, and then he said that there was going to be another shot of pain, and this would be worse than the last. Fuck. “Ok, good to know,” I said. And as I clenched my fists to try to have control over some part of my body, the pain hit me. I gasped again, but remembered this time to breathe. And as I breathed back out I said, “JEEEEZUS!” almost involuntarily.
And by the time you do get to speak with someone, are you receptive to what they have to say??

Plans are well underway to move to NL in about a month. What an undertaking. Well worth the effort but somewhat daunting. Don't expect much in the way of blogging for the next while though I do have some almost finished posts ready to schedule so I won't disappear completely. It appears that I will be in my home town of Change Islands at exactly the same time that I was last year. I'm looking forward to walking some of the same trails and climbing some of the same hills I did a year ago. I don't think anything will be as magical as that trip was but perhaps it'll be close. And who knows, perhaps it'll be better! The milky way still lowers itself each night like a starlit blanket and the ocean will still be that remarkable blue that I've rarely seen in any other setting. I'll dream under the North Star and become inspired by the setting sun. I believe in magic. It's that place that makes me believe, so why not?
Russell Lee and Jack Delano were the main photographers, and at the time worked for the Farm Security Administration/Office of War Information The locations of the photos range from New Mexico to Texas to Massachusetts to Maine and "are some of the only color photographs taken of the effects of the Depression on America’s rural and small town populations. The photographs and captions are the property of the Library of Congress and were included in a 2006 exhibit Bound for Glory: America in Color."

There have been quite a few digital album deals I have had to pass on due to insufficient time to locate, assemble, and upload images to a site and then organize said images into a digital album (not much on the auto-fill option as I am a bit of a perfectionist).
But you know what they say about the weather. “If you don’t like it, just wait five minutes.” It took about an hour for the fog to start burning off but I had a fantastic time taking some shots along the harbour. Many images end up looking pretty surreal.
I love The Music Tapes. Period. Seeing them live and interviewing them was pretty much how this blog came to be. Their records spin endlessly in my room, and their performance as part of the Elephant 6 Holiday Surprise Tour was one of my musical high points of the year. They are wonderful, and the only thing I wished from the band was that they would release more music, seeing as they have only released two albums in eleven years.
Thanks again to all of you!

Another way is to confer to others a range of possible thoughts or motives, and to be intentional when we treat them as if their motives are the noblest ones.
But there is an ominous explanation that lay behind this folly—an even greater folly: (1) They “did not remember the Lord their God, who had rescued them from the hands of all their enemies,” and (2) they “failed to show kindness” (Judg. 8:34-35).
I am also very RELIEVED! You see, I have homeschooled Ruby since pre-school and had a lot of people who were convinced I was going to turn her into this backward little weirdo who spent all day hiding in the basement, talking to her imaginary friends... (That would actually be ME and I went to public school.) Instead she turned into an intelligent, beautiful lady who regularly wears out the batteries on my phone. Where is this quiet, antisocial kid these people promised me?!!! They ought to have to pay our phone bill! Sheesh.... LOL If the other 3 munchkins grow up to be even half this awesome I will die a happy mama! ;o)

Less well recorded is what happened to the act after Cliff Bennett left the band (or was 'booted out' depending upon which story you believe) to form Toe Fat. Logically enough, they decided to continue as the plain old Rebel Rousers, and whilst Bennett's vocals are much missed on this single, the other elements remain intact. Both sides are equally strong, brittle and blaring pieces of brightly coloured pop created with the dancefloor in mind, and that the record wasn't a hit probably had more to do with the trends of the time than anything else - this sort of thing was incredibly passe by 1968, and Bennett's instincts to get a bit more sophisticated with Toe Fat seem, in this respect at least, less misguided than they may first appear. Still, the flip "As I Look" was later compiled as part of the "Chocolate Soup for Diabetics" series, and remains a favourite among retro DJs across the UK, regularly filling floors at mod nights. The copy I have is clearly a rather amateurishly produced bootleg made for the benefit of such wheel-of-steel spinners (I've never seen an original copy for sale anywhere) but it plays brilliantly despite the murky looking label.

As far as other I'd Rather By Flying releases the only one I am certain exists is the track "Satellite" which appears on the Next Year We'll Be Robots Volume 1 cassette on Robin Hood Records that also featured Silver Scooter, Soul Junk, Rop Style UFO, Nova Scotias and others. I know Jason spoke of tapes he made and perhaps some other comp appearances but I am not certain as to the details. I do have one other unnamed track in my possession but upon hearing the song it sounds like it was a personal gift for someone special not to be shared. And it is master cassette for a 4 track. How I came about it is most likely a result of doing some 4 track stuff at Tommy Orza's (OTMOP bassist) house one day and the tape someone ended up in my box of tapes. Most likely Tommy and Jason were doing some 4 track stuff and the cassette was one the floor and yeah. We were young and unorganized. What I am getting at it doesn't feel right sharing that tune. Unless of course Jason says it is okay...

These cover commercial buildings (e.g. office blocks, shopping mall, food centre etc), mixed commercial and residential buildings (e.g. apartment blocks with a shopping podium), and residential with commercial use on the 1st storey (e.g. shophouses, and developments with shops on the first storey and apartments above).
Another way the exhibit empowers visitors is through FITE’s (Financial Independence Through Entrepreneurship) on-site micro-lending program. Thanks to a generous donation by Dermalogica, DNA Foundation, and KIVA, every visitor receives a micro-loan coded card. Visitors then step up to an on-site kiosk where they can activate the pre-assigned sum on the card for a woman who is turning her own oppression into opportunities (visitors can choose the region of the world as well as the industry they personally wish to support; that information translates into a loan recipient). Each micro-loan designated at the kiosks helps to allow a woman to go out and purchase materials or seeds for her farming operations, or for another to buy yarns for her hand-crafted materials on sale in her small shop. In turn, proceeds from these small, mostly artisan-based businesses empower women financially, allowing them constructively contribute to their small communities.

Big Top Rock at Teatro ZinZanni is the perfect venue for the bands of Seattle’s Kindiependent music collective, and the sold-out Oct. 8 show with Johnny Bregar & the Country Dawgs and Recess Monkey was a thoroughly captivating trifecta of fun.

It was then like a scene from a movie – while they were rounding people into my room, I called my husband and we both knew he’d never make it. They made one attempt at an IV in my room and my OB finally said something along the lines of “we don’t have time for this – she’s got to go NOW”. I was then flying through the hallways – I was so scared that I was physically trembling. I went right into the OR and there wasn’t even time to give me a spinal so I was put under general anesthesia and that’s the last I remember before waking up in excruciating pain in recovery.

And not surprisingly, much disinformation about NESARA can be found on the internet. Prominent nay-sayers include quatloos.com, which is rumored to be a CIA front; nesara.org which is maintained by the Bush family; Sherry Shriner; and various Internet channelers receiving their messages from telepathic spooks have all contributed to the confusion.

Incensed by Obamacare, the issue that ignited the creation of the Tea Party movement, by the failed stimulus, by scandals involving “green energy” companies that cost Americans millions, by Fast and Furious, an Obama administration sponsored gun-running operation, and the sluggish “recovery”, Obama already faces an uphill battle for reelection.

Hi everyone, how have you all been? A bit of a special one today... here we have a double feature post consisting of two manis using a spectraflair franken I made. A little backstory behind this franken is that I actually bought the pigment from a seller online who has been providing the special rainbow magic to tons of us in the nail polish community. Sadly, I heard that he recently passed away. These manis are a thank you to Sid - you will be missed! Thanks for providing us with endless possibilities to create some awesome polishes and enjoy what we love! =D

Kathy had an enormous cherry blossom tree in her front garden, which rained pink confetti in spring and sprouted beautiful, dark emerald leaves as the summer progressed. Our beech hedge was flourishing and the pears, apples and cherries ripened in the heat. The house across the road was almost habitable. Two men in overalls sat on the roof, replacing broken slates. And the old man walked his dog.

our c-section was booked for 7:45am and we were to arrive at the hospital at 5:45am to get prepped, etc. the night before was surreal. i was sitting on the couch with mr. wannabe and gigantor (as he was fondly referred to as back then) was moving around like crazy ... it was almost as though he knew it was getting close to his time to break out and he wanted me to remember how awesome it was to feel him wiggling around. i was pretty wired that night and didn't get to sleep until about midnight and our alarms went off at 4am. in the morning i was unusually calm. the only thing i was worried about was getting the spinal. i didn't give a shit about the fact that dr. love was cutting me open. strange.
Be encouraged, friends! Have a great week!

As it's Thursday it's time for a new Willow Sketchie Challenge and this week our host is Lisa and she has created a fab sketch I think you will agree but as most of the DT had followed the sketch and theme, I decided to just follow the theme for my card which is "Let them eat cake" so we want to see food on your cards this week. or you can follow the sketch or both.
Just this week, Jim reseeded nine acres of alfalfa. The original seed was in the ground for almost a month with no rain, and was not sprouting, so he went over the fields with a no till drill and new seed. His hope is, that with this rain, the newly seeded alfalfa will sprout, along with some of the old seed, making a thick stand.
The novel tells the story of the run up to London 2012 and poses many what if scenarios: what if a dodgy sports agent was able to get at rival competitors? What if a terrorist cell based in the UK did the unthinkable and penetrated the tight security cordon that rings the Games venues, even as we speak?

I was driving the kids to school the other day, and we passed by a car that was pulled over by a couple police officers. My daughter said that the police were helping the person whose car was broken or out of gas. I went ahead and told her that they had actually stopped the car because the person in the car had done something they shouldn't have.
The goals you have in life, the major ones that is, are hard to grasp sometimes. They seem so far away, like we come so far only to go even further and it always seem just out of reach. Today, you need to stop looking at where the goal is, but where you are and be proud of how far you come. For example, my business, four years ago it was looking on the verge of death and we were pretty scared here. One by one new clients came in and every month we got better, then every year we became more stable, till finally this year we got too much work and needed to grow. We are still not where we want to be, but I will take where we are and proud of what we did to make it.
1. The kind souls. These are the people who do not mean what they say because they are terrified of hurting someone’s feelings. They will compliment a friend on a bad haircut, horrible looking outfit, or painful solo at church. They cannot imagine telling the truth because they would feel horrible if they caused any sort of pain or discomfort to others.
You might not be able to have your cake and eat it too, but you can with fish!
Moaners will say “it’s not a traditional pub, though, is it?”, to which one can only point out that the weirdly fossilised pseudo-Victorian pub interiors favoured by pub companies are very much a historical aberration. Glasgow bars have often been refurbished in modern style, as the few remaining examples of 1930s art deco bars show. One thing I do find annoying is how loud the place is. It’s hard to hear yourself talk across the wide tables when even a few other customers are in. When it’s full it’ll be deafening.

On the way to work, I remember that today, parents are coming to watch my class. No sweat. They're a good class, I'm a good teacher. It's fine. Until Mrs. Lee appears and is a flurry of nervous energy and Yuna, my co-teacher, is trying to explain to me the lesson plan, but can't fully and so enlists the aid of Cindy.
I will never forget the face on the last three guys to finish, Marty, John and Art. They finished around 9:30PM at the Bright Angel Trailhead. It appeared they all had hypothermia and severe exhaustion. They shook as they tried to put food and warm drinks into their pale and wide-eyed faces. They all looked as if they had seen a ghost. Perhaps they had. They had stuck it out and pushed each other to get out safely but perhaps not sanely. Everyone that went into the canyon on this day is an inspiration. Most of these people have jobs and families but still find time to get out and enjoy such adventures, not to mention train for them beforehand.
“Now I am reminding you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you indeed received and in which you also stand. Through it you are also being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.” (1 Corinthians 15:1-2, emphasis added)

So although this house looks typically English, a representative of the order and elegance of its period, it would not have seemed that way to contemporaries. As course upon course of bricks was laid (and bricks themselves were unusual in this area in 1678), the neighbours would have been shocked at the difference from the traditional stone or timber-framed houses – asymmetrical, low-slung, with small windows and often thatched roofs – of the area. Architecture was changing, before their eyes.

The first segment served as a sort of prelude to the album; it was dark and drew me into the journey that I wasn’t prepared for. It ushered in what sounded like church bells in a rustic backstreet somewhere in Europe. I felt like I was hearing a call to prayer.

The sketch called for a sentiment on an oval in the lower right corner but because I already had the sentiment in the photo, I cut out a star, pen stitched in the centre to mimic the background, and attached it with glue dots for some dimension. The glue dots are white but they show a wee bit so I coloured them blue with a TomBow marker.

I'm a voracious reader. Always have been. As a teenager, my parents ended up having to hide my books so I would get my chores done because I would spend every chance I got reading. It didn't really change when I had a family, except no one had to hide my books so I'd get my chores done. :P
Adding to that was the fact that Lido had traced his keen eye along the secret door's edge and noted a large heavy rope net was hung on the ceiling covering entranceway for about ten feet square. He had pointed to it, and the others had nodded. It seemed that they needed more options to consider, and so they all took to thinking.

O cleanse me from my secret faults! Keep your servant also from presumptuous sins lest they get dominion over me; so shall I be undefiled, and innocent of great offence. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, my strength and my redeemer.

26 hours have passed since I last ate, and I can truly tell you I am not hungry right now. I never thought I would say this after a fast, but it's true. Of course, I had cravings and was hungry throughout the day, but I made mental effort to prepare myself and I succeeded at enjoying the beginning of this cleanse.
Here are the 11 questions given to me by Melissa:
we hear this a lot.
It will be making its rhubarb reign debut very soon! Just down the street was an outpost of the popular local thrift store chain, the Brown Elephant. The racks were packed with all sorts of vintage treasures, but I had a hard time keeping my eyes off the surroundings. Once upon a time, the building must have been a theater. What a fabulous setting -- crusty, crumbly and oh-so-romantic. Again, if I lived closer, I'd be a regular.
After I had a good collection of ideas on paper, I stepped back to decide which sconce to tackle first. The idea that appealed to me the most was a 3 candle wall sconce with antlers on each end of the sconce. Now to find the materials. I selected a couple pieces of wood that I thought would make a nice sconce face and shelf, and then I looked through my collection of antlers and found an interesting, smaller rack that I decided to cut apart to mount to each end of the sconce. After cutting the wood to the appropriate sizes, I began the work of sanding the pieces to a smooth, even surface. I used a combination of my power orbital sander and careful hand sanding to make those pieces as soft and smooth as a baby’s bottom, which took a considerable amount of time and effort. Still loving the burned edge look, I used my trusty torch to carefully burn all 4 edges of the sconce face and the 3 visible edges of the shelf. The next step was to decide how I wanted to have the candles sit on the shelf. I came to the realization that I wanted the candle holders to sit in recessed holes on the top of the shelf to prevent them from shifting or falling. This required a couple more purchases. First, I had to find the candle holders that I wanted to use. I ended up choosing smoky colored, tea light holders because I thought they would match the burned edges of the wood and pull the piece together. I decided to also get some of the battery operated, flameless tea lights because I didn’t want to have to worry about fire hazards with open flames near varnished wood. Better safe than sorry. After buying the candle holders and candles, I had to buy a set of drill bits to make the depressions in the shelf. I ended up getting a set of bits ranging from 1/4″-2 1/8″ so I would have the bits to make many different sized holes for this project and projects of the future. Plus, I got 10 bits for about double what 1 2″ bit would’ve cost me. Good deal.
For some who don’t know Ray J is an on again off again music artist, reality TV star and actor. At one time, he was more popular for simply being musical artist, Brandy’s brother. At this point with the popularity of Kim Kardashian, he is better known as the guy in the explicit video that raised her to prominence, through that “private” tape being leaked to the public. The bottom line is, he is more popular for who he is associated with, than what he has accomplished personally.
With that, I took a splurge. I look forward to Thursday run day to test them out.

So, I've been having loads of contractions--maybe 5-6 an hour. They don't hurt, there's no pattern, they're all in my belly, and there is nothing else going on anywhere else. But I've never had this many (it's been going on for a couple of days), and it's kind of freaky. I talked to the doctor yesterday, and absent any other symptoms, she's not worried, although she did tell me to take it easy this weekend. I've been a good girl and have been sitting on my couch all morning.

Secondly, much of this research is conducted in the context of policy discussions regarding whether the public provision of preschool should be pursued through universal or targeted programs. For parents like Ava and I who are trying to determine how many thousands of dollars we should be willing to pay for our children to go to a good preschool, these discussions offer little guidance.

It’s hard writing this. I haven’t finished the song. The thoughts are disjointed and I’m partly suspicious of writing about the whole process – it can be crippling and disturbing to the flow to do so. I’ve also been reading and listening to a lot of recent Leonard Cohen interviews and he is VERY suspicious and cautious about discussing the so-called mechanics of writing. Doing so can stop you from writing another word ever again…

After juggling the demands of her career and the stress of caring for her ailing mother, Tori Anderson doesn’t have time for relationships—but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t want to feel like a woman. When Brit offers a no-strings attached fling, it sounds like exactly what she needs. But what will she do when Brit decides he won’t take “one night stand” for an answer? When Tori uncovers his lies, will he lose his chance with her forever?

Hockey’s blessing is that in every generation, someone—whether the stars of the Montagnards way back when, or Tarasov and Bobrov in the fifties, or Guy Lafleur and the Montreal Canadiens in the seventies—comes along to redeem the game by making it the matchlessly thrilling thing it can be.

Now onto Spring. I’ll be following Hyouka, Saki Achiga, Natsuiro Kiseki, and Fate/Zero‘s second half. My expectations go from “should be great”, “love the source material”, “eh, I’ll give a shot”, and “Let’s see how this finishes.” Nothing else interests me at the moment, so hopefully I’ll get the desire to work on translating a lot instead. The current projects shouldn’t take much longer to complete, so look for the new ones shortly.
After spending time posting on the diary, the rain finally stopped and we went to the Farmer's Market. It was very windy and the merchants were holding their tents to keep them from blowing away. Despite the heavy rain earlier, all the merchants were set up for business. We purchased fresh ciabatta bread, tomatoes (can't get enough of these fresh ones), and a bouquet.
I love that answer!
It gives you just about almost everything you must look and feel ideal for that occasion. And did additionally you recognize that the colour red has long been scientifically verified to elevate your self-confidence? Yup, it is really certainly a must-own look-effortlessly-hot product!

Happy Saturday my sweet friends..
The punctuation in the third sentence makes the sentence awkward. I think you're using it here to mean a pause. Generally dashes meaning a pause are used as interruptions, from one speaker to another. The reason this doesn't work is what follows: the clause both morally and physically, he cannot act as his own executioner.
On another end of the spectrum is the Imperial Workhorse IPA. The original gravity was bumped up from 17º Plato to 19.5º Plato resulting in an ABV of about 9.5%. To balance this out, the hops were increased to contribute about 15 more IBUs over the standard Workhorse. This beer contains plenty of hops presenting a firm bitterness and a pleasant resinous character. The malts provide a good balance with some sweetness coming through. I overheard mention that no hop extract was used but that some hop pellets were ground up before use in hopes of better utilization. Not as cloying as this year's Green Mammoth but also lacking some of the over the top aromatics of that brew, this fits in nicely between that and their standard IPAs.
It’s not something I am proud of, yet also not something I am ashamed to do — but after polishing off a packet of one of these candies, I can’t help but gather the remaining sugar along the bottom of the bag and eat it. Now, I have varying methods. Sometimes I outright lick the bag. Other times I turn the bag over and pour it directly into my mouth. My preferred technique? Swiping my index finger along the sugary piles until gone.

What is the book about? It’s about a boy and his two dogs, the things they go through together, hunting coons, making miracles happen, saving each others’ lives.
I appreciate your empathy and concern for the trauma I have experienced. I feel similarly for you. The bullying and self-esteem damage that the children we were experienced really wasn't okay. If I made it sound like I wished my life had gone differently I want to say I most certainly don't. I am who I am because of those experiences and once I had children I never wished to go back. My parents suffered in worse ways than me and my children have it much better than I did. I learned very much like you to overcome and deal with unpleasant life experiences. Those that knew me when I was younger have indicated they are amazed I turned out as well as I did. Yes life does throw curves but so many of those so called curves are artificial. Life is challenging enough without adding more difficulties. And I choose to play basketball rather than baseball. I may encounter defense in my desire to score but there are so many more options available that lead to success other than swinging a bat. All I need to play basketball is a ball and a hoop. I can play it with a team or by myself. Baseball doesn't work so well by yourself and usually it requires a whole bunch more players.
who clothed himself in clay
Haven’t done much chatting since my friend has not been around much this week. Been busy with other things. I rarely venture into any random chat rooms these days. I’m kind of happy just to visit one or two rooms on a regular basis. After all the years I’ve put into it I have started to feel like I’d want to do something else with my time. Sure it’s fun making new friends but there are also other aspects which are not as much fun.
Some may think a bragging buddy dangerously promotes arrogance. Acuff suggests a private “bragging table” is safe middle ground between arrogance and feeling ashamed of personal desires to share our accomplishments.

The colours above are, from left to right, Hazelnut, Vermont Apple, Sunrise, Bubblegum, Winter Sky, Sunrise (again), Bloomin', and Vermont Rosewood. I had a hard time making up my mind - they are all so beautiful - and Linda allowed me to order a mixed set. I can't wait! But I have to wait - for Tom to get the wood and to make them by hand - each one, just for me. Linda will make my case and Tom will sign it. There is just no comparison. I'll love using my exceptional knitting tools!
We were driving around seeing the mountains and the sandy beaches when we came across this old road, there should have been signs but there weren't. There was an old fence that was partially down and Codie and I thought what they hell lets see where it goes. It looked like such beautiful scenery down that road and we took the temptation. We turned onto it and drove around the dilapidated partially down fence. Half way down we realized the road signs had changed, they went from kilometres to miles per hour. UH OH. When it dawned on us I started freaking out OMG Codie We are in the United States and I don't have a passport!!!
The truth is- I am terrified. I declined all prenatal testing with her- just as I did with her brothers- because I KNOW it doesn't matter. In my heart, I KNOW that no matter what I will love her.

The film concludes the next day, with the survivors rigging up a radio receiver and listening for news of the attacks. To their surprise, the radio broadcast doesn't mention the attacks, indicating that the outside world is oblivious to what has happened. Hansen pries off the boards from one of the lodge's windows, and discovers that the entire building is encased in a giant web cocoon. The camera pulls back, and all of Camp Verde is encased in cocoons as well.
That was all it took to catch the attention of the apocalyptically minded. David Berg aka Moses David, leader of the Children of God sect, did the most to publicize a Kohoutek apocalypse; his proclamation that the comet would destroy the world in January of 1974, printed on bright orange flyers, was handed out by his followers to people all over North America. (I think I may still have one in a file box in the basement.) All through the last months of 1973, the comet had something of the same cachet that the supposed end of the Mayan calendar has today.

Next, I am happy to share with you that Ann from Cooking Healthy For Me, who is constantly so kind with her compliments have awarded me the "Versatile Blogger" Award. Now that's really AWESOME! Never thought I can be versatile. However, I believe that I am. Part of the award is that I have to share with you 7 things that you might already know or may not know about me. But first, let me award 15 bloggers, who are my new foodie friends and maybe a couple who are pioneers in food blogging.. THANKS for constantly stopping by to buzz me here.

Professional sound systems vary greatly in terms of size and features. Some sound systems are portable and others are fixed. Audio systems are designed for different locales and acoustics, some will serve well to address a single room of listeners and others can address stadium size crowds. The advantage of having a professional sound system is that they deliver superior sound to meet your needs.
So if you feel as your joy is somewhat lacking, try taking some time to notice what’s around you, practise mindfulness even if only for a few moments each day and the Universe will bless you.
This year has been both busy and stressful for me. Like my flight around the coast of Australia, not everything has gone to plan. I’ve achieved some of my goals but others have had to be moved to 2012.
Before we start this week's challenge, want to point out a few changes we are making here at One Stitch At A Time...
It was convenient in some ways, but I immediately noticed a difference in how people reacted to me. In fact, I gained a degree of invisibility as a short woman with short hair, and mostly that's not a good thing when it is already a struggle to be taken seriously.
Nunez-Tesheira is now alleging that the Integrity Commission failed to properly notify her of exactly what possible charges have been notified to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I understand that the charges relate to an allegation that the CLF shareholding held by Nunez-Tesheira amounts to a conflict of interest in relation to the discharge of her duties as Minister of Finance at the time of the bailout.

I'm tired of latte liberals and journalists, who would never wear the uniform of the Republic themselves, or let their entitlement-handicapped kids near a recruiting station, trashing our military. They and their kids can sit at home, never having to make split-second decisions under life and death circumstances, and bad mouth better people than themselves. Do bad things happen in war? You bet. Do our troops sometimes misbehave? Sure. Does this compare with the atrocities that were the policy of our enemies for the last fifty years and still are? Not even close. So here's the deal. I'll let myself be subjected to all the humiliation and abuse that was heaped on terrorists at Abu Ghraib or Gitmo, and the critics can let themselves be subject to captivity by the Muslims, who tortured and beheaded Daniel Pearl in Pakistan, or the Muslims who tortured and murdered Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins in Lebanon, or the Muslims who ran the blood-spattered Al Qaeda torture rooms our troops found in Iraq, or the Muslims who cut off the heads of schoolgirls in Indonesia, because the girls were Christian. Then we'll compare notes. British and American soldiers are the only troops in history that civilians came to for help and handouts, instead of hiding from in fear.
I think self-publishing’s big downside is that it provides writers the means to just jump in before they’re seasoned. And it’s not as simple as that the manuscript isn’t ready, or the cover isn’t good, or whatever (though those things really aren’t simple at all). It’s about understanding oneself as an artist and a businessperson, and knowing where and how to fit in. And that understanding comes slowly…even while self-publishing makes publishing and distribution into things that can happen easily and fast.
New, punitive and potentially invasive laws such as the London Olympic Games Act 2006 are in force. This legitimise the use of force, potentially by private security companies, to proscribe Occupy-style protests. They also allow Olympic security personnel to deal forcibly with the display of any commercial material that is deemed to challenge the complete management of London as a "clean city" to be branded for the global TV audience wholly by prime corporate sponsors (including McDonald’s, Visa and Dow Chemical).

Lemelson teaches a catheter with embedded optical fibers that are used for conveying illumination to and optical signals from target tissues. " ... light directed along and from the end of light pipe 22 is reflected through fluid, such as body liquid existing in cavity 16 and is modulated by the physical and chemical contents of such body fluid, causing variations in the content of such light, which variations may be detected by one or more techniques including computerized signal analysis of the electrical signals generated when the modulated light is converted to electrical signals. Furthermore, such received light may also be spectrographically analyzed to permit the light passing through the fluid sample to detect both physical and chemical variables present in the fluid being scanned thereby". Lemelson discloses that his device is capable of use with "medical materials" dispensers. Lemelson discusses using his catheter for cytometry.
Alligators - They have them and in abundance. They will not eat you unless you are stupid. If you are stupid, and you know who you are, stay home. That goes for noisy, reckless, a litter bug, or just plain ignorant. This river and all the plants and animals who live in it were here long before you were. Try and remember you are visiting their home and use some of that common sense and common courtesy that seems so rare these days.

Ahhh Monday, what a beautiful day of the week. How many post can I make about this wonderful day? Personally, I think millions. Yup, this is the day most people joke about, hate, and just wish was never around, but again today we need to stress the importance of a Monday.
Our first place, where we lived for three years, overlooked a giant construction site where they basically took out half a mountain to build a big shopping complex. There were huge klieg lights on at all hours, so in winter at night we had orange artifical light streaming in the windows constantly (never remember seeing the moon) and the dynamiting of the rock was so loud that I had to push glassware back onto the shelves or it would start to vibrate off.
You must understand printing lies about Republican candidates is OK. It’s called “vetting.” Printing the truth about liberals – that’s called “swift-boating.” From career MSNBC jock sniffer Keith Olbermann to Barney Frank’s favorite publisher Jann Wenner, the verdict on Palin is unanimous.
The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.
To overcome this situation a holistic approach is required where we take inputs from facilities management and IT management and come up with complete picture of data center infrastructure usage and impact of business demand. Peter Drucker rightly said “If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it”. This is very true for Capacity Management process. To effectively manage a data center IT managers should be able to see what is happening on both the IT and Infrastructure sides.

Everywhere on facebook, on yahoo news, on Huff, everyone's talking about the super moon. Some are even wondering if it will cause problems. There's even an article on myths about the moon. Everybody's out taking pictures of the moon and posting it.
Hi Dawn, I loved your interview. You did not look as bad as you said you did.

We had not sold our house before we moved, so we hired a leasing company to lease it to a family who was supposed to buy it, but didn’t, after two years. It took them four months to find a family to agree to a two-year lease, during which time we were responsible for the rent on an apartment and our old mortgage payments. It took us three years to sell our house in Nashville, a house we didn’t want to leave, and that’s longer than we lived in it. I could go on and on about the leasing company and the family in our home not paying the homeowner’s association dues until a lien was placed on our house, the times our payments from the leasing company were late, or when they stopped paying us altogether, even though the people they put there were still occupying the residence. But we got the house sold, and we were eventually able to purchase one which is approximately the same size. Our housing situation is OK, though our neighbors and our neighborhood are far less desirable.
“Oh, sir!” she exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but this telegram has just come,” and she thrust it into his hand.

A few years ago I wrote about Richard Stanley’s Vodou documentary, “The White Darkness.” I wanted a copy but could not find it on DVD for sale after watching it via Netflix.

As he got going, his eyes turned to watch my reaction. When I didn’t move to stop him, he started ramping up the volume and raising his arms above his head. Polly followed right along with him and by the time they made their second pass through the Triumphant Peter theme, they were singing so loud that Ava could easily hear them from her spot in the buffet line and the people to our left were openly gawking at us with a mixture of amusement and incredulity.

A week later the entire family was wheeled down rain-slicked Woodward Avenue, parade-style, each in a coffin of appropriate size. The public funeral was an opportunity for police to look for the killer in the crowd, but to no avail.

The trees about me and those on the opposite bank were also vibrating. I had an impulse to go over to the trees on the opposite bank and touch them. A part of me, I did not know which part, stood up and moved over to where the tree was standing. As I looked about from my position on the opposite bank, everything around me was in this blur of vibration. The sound of the tone I was emitting was everywhere felt and repeated this vibration over and over again and with every breath it was reinforced.

On a more serious note, one of our team members had trouble passing through security. Mike has a battery powered breathing machine that security would not allow him to take on the plane. While Ivanildo went to intervene, I felt prompted to pray for the situation. Ivanildo told security that Mike was disabled and he needed the apparatus while he was traveling. Security finally allowed Mike to carry his battery. Praise You Jesus!!!

We live in a culture that so values goal-setting and achievement, that it's no wonder contentedness is barely on the radar, that my automatic response to the word has been a sense of dullness and disinterest. I mean, if you don't want anything, what fun is that? What would motivate you to get up in the morning and DO anything? Who would ever receive special recognition for how content they are?
A few years ago, we purchased a new car for towing. We don't use a windshield cover nor do we use a shield. The only protection for our towed car are the large mud flaps behind our motorhome's rear tires and a solid, heavy mud flap the width of the rear bumper that almost touches the ground.
After my easy workout, I got back in my car and drove a few miles downtown to the Nashville Women’s Half Marathon 5k course I will be doing in less than a month I wanted to drive the course and see what to expect. It looks like it will be a good course. There are a few hills but nothing too daunting.

I’ve said before that a writer’s natural response to life is to write about it. It’s also their natural response to death it appears. Shadow Child was not Pieter Thomése’s first book. He had written five before it and he has written five more since finishing it. It differs from the others in that the child, Isa, was his. And his wife’s, of course, but this is not so much about her or even about them as a couple coping with the death of a child; it is about a writer’s attempt to preserve his baby daughter in words. When Paul Auster’s father died he did exactly the same, he sat down and penned the memoir Portrait of an Invisible Man in which he writes:
Funny how reading about the catastrophies of protagonists makes you feel better about your own life, and yet you wish you were them. Hmmm.
Having the one diet coke a day is lovely. (My only real side effect, I should mention, was a slight headache, no doubt due to the reduced caffeine intake.) However, this diet is so low salt that the Diet Coke isn’t as good as it could be if I’d just eaten salty nuts or beef jerky. But can’t think that way.

After recently finding myself unemployed, I've been trying to save money on food while trying to keep things tasty and healthy.

If the scheme is the same as it is with chickens, and I imagine this applies to all birds, she first makes the nest, but doesn't sit on the eggs until she has laid as many as she considers make up a decent family, so we should see one extra egg a day until she decides to sit. This is obviously so that all the eggs hatch at more or less the same time.

Akhee Ahn : My bandmates already told everything... I was a big fan of 60's garage music, but I want to localize this kind of music. And I don't want to stuck in the time of 60's. cos we're the people of 21st century. I love 60's garage (The Sonics, The Seeds, etc) and 70's Korean rock (Shin Jung Hyun, Kim Jung Mi, Kim Choo Ja, Mujigae Quintet, etc) and Japanese GS (The spiders, The Tempters, The Carnabeats, Lind and Linders, etc). Oh, too many to say. Originally I was in a psychobilly band, so I think it's time to play the melody of East Asia.
I did. She replied "Was it a lucid dream?" I said, "Yes." She said, matter-of-factly, "Well, that's what it was, then." She thanked me for telling her about it, and said, to end the conversation, "It WAS real, you know."

But, sure, this is a serious geopolitical and military problem: if you conduct basically a triage of the world's human population – where some people are exiled from the world economy, and some spaces no longer have roles – then you’re offering up ideal opportunities for other people to step in and organize those spaces to their own ends. This is a deeper and more profound situation than any putative conflicts of civilization. It is, in a way, a very unexpected end to the 20th century. Neither classical Marxism, nor any other variety of classical social theory or neoliberal economics, ever predicted that such a large fraction of humanity would live in cities and yet basically outside all the formal institutions of the world economy.

In a skillet, cook bacon that has been cut into small pieces. As the bacon is cooking add very small diced onion. Saute on medium high heat until onion is carmelized and bacon is crispy. Add minced garlic and cook for a minute or two more. Add the sweet potatoes and beets to the bacon and onions and stir.
As for claims that you are a tiprat, I say embrace them.

Any wise person would insist that our society needs to learn how to accept death as a part of life. I think of Kim, and her grace and honesty as her own death approached, and I understand this now in a way that I did not before. While I am in great health now, I know also that I am here on loan, and by the same grace she was. What Kim taught me, in the way she lived before she was sick, and the way she remained herself afterwards, was to embrace and to be and to love. To cherish those many, many connections that make us feel life all the more deeply. And writing these letters is a way for me to express that in some way.

For the last few weeks I have been desperately trying to find the coloured Copic MultiLiner SP pens in cool grey and pink for my illustrations, and I couldn't find them anywhere. I could special order them through my work, but there was a 6 minimum quantity. I almost did it despite my frustration about it, when I visited the store across the street from me, Petrovs (which I avoid because the customer service is atrocious and the woman who owns it was cruel to me) and they had the disposable Copic Multiliners just not in pink, but I did get greys.

Readers Digest: Shortly after I moved in the Landlord informed me she would be selling the house. Shortly after that she stopped communicating with me all together. She has not responded to numerous texts, phone calls, or emails since mid October. Including texts and phone calls informing her my toilet had completely busted. I have asked her to be truthful with me about her intentions and she ignores me. One time I came home at lunch early and she happened to be at the house working. She literally hid from me, and when I found her she faked a phone call, so I said fuck it and left. I needed to get back to work.

Try a few different rollers to see which you sleep best in, how to set them, and what produces the best result for your hair. Its almost different for everyone. So you really do need to experiment. As a general rule, smoother rollers produce best results, but are also harder to wind and secure poorly for overnight. Here are some notes on a few types of rollers:

We have granted the first premise then. What about the second premise? This is where I have a hearty chuckle. Most of the time we are dealing with militant, sometimes even radical atheists or at least anti-Christians who have absolutely no rational justification for their own conceptions of what is right and wrong. These people are almost entirely products of the society that produced them, unconscious idea-sponges who in spite of their pretensions to the contrary have never had a critical or original thought in their lives. So how exactly do they “know” that slavery is wrong? When exactly was this hypothesis tested and verified by the scientific method? Where are the research papers and double-blind studies that establish the truth of this moral proposition?
“At the end of the Don Juan story, as I remember it, he is having dinner with Doña Aminta who is a depressed, boring, unhappy woman. But he has also invited the Stone Guest to dinner – the ghost of Don Gonzalo, whom he killed. While Doña Aminta is praying, the hellish Stone Guest invites Don Juan to follow him to Hell. He is not dragged or kidnapped…he has a free choice between life with a depressive, unhappy woman and the road to Hell. And Don Juan chooses to go to Hell. That’s my choice too. I want to be engulfed in the flames.

One way to make the most of social networking sites is to tie them to attractive sales promotions. People will want to like your Facebook page if they know this is a good way to have access to discounts. Social networking sites should be used so that your customers can have a better understand of you and your company. They should also start to be a little more closely involved with your products and brands.

The real irony is that I work at a fucking fast food chain. I feel like that teenager that all the adults are secretly laughing at, murmuring about how I’ll change my tune in a couple of years, grow out of it, settle down and have my 1.5 children or whatever the fuck the average is now. I’m still too immature, I still talk like an angsty 14 year old. But it doesn’t matter, because I see them now, I see them for what they all are: teenagers with kids and bank accounts. They never grow up, and they certainly never gain enough intelligence to recognize that fact. The world is stagnant, nothing but a putrid cesspool we continue to dirty.

The change in the law, which was initiated by Labour and is now on the statute book, would cut both ways. Fathers who do not want to be named on a birth certificate would – like mothers who refuse to name a father – be breaking the law and be liable for a financial penalty.
Why do we have to beg white society for the rights that are supposed to be inherent? Explicitly our right to LIFE? our right to LIBERTY? This is the America black people know…..the one where we have to beg those who oppress us to stop long enough for us to get to our feet, the one where we have to beg white people to see it in their hearts to prosecute someone who is CLEARLY guilty of a hate crime. Trayvon Martin was LYNCHED and life went back to normal for the Zimmerman’s, the black community then had to get on its knees and work, really work, beg for the attention of white run news stations and white reporters and white run “justice” departments to do what they are SUPPOSED TO DO, report, prosecute, uphold the law, protect the RIGHTS of human beings. Why do people of color have to beg these institutions for rights that are inherent? What is it about being a black person in America that makes the news, the judicial system and society disregard you as non-human? Everyone is so gungho about this being America, they love to recite our bill of rights until black people ask to be protected under them. Life is an unalienable right….but if you’re black you have to ask white people to grant that right to you. White people should have NEVER had the power to grant black people rights, they should have NEVER had the power to deny them. But the reality is that since slavery white people have held the rights of black people in the palm of their hands and they pass out justice when they feel like it and I guess in the case of Trayvon Martin….they didnt feel like it until this teenager was cold and dead for a month. I say ‘begging the white power structure for justice again” because this is not the first …nor will it be the last time we have to find white people to get behind us in order to get justice. This is not going to be the last time we have to beg new stations and papers to put out a story on behalf of a victim of murder and hate.

Sports are competitive. They were originally played to promote health, but through time they became a matter of who’s best. With the exception of college football’s Bowl Championship Series, which is finally changing to a four-team playoff, the current systems the various leagues use to determine the best in their sport, generally work well. Teams play a regular season to contend in the playoffs and ultimately share a common goal of becoming champion.

Oh, another remake. And I'm not for sure on how I feel about this one yet. It was fairly well-made, and James Marsden didn't bother as much as he usually does so that's a plus. But they break away from the main storyline too much and dwells on that Jeremy dude who apparently is some kind of pedophile but it's never explained. Speaking of that, the rape scene here is just as confusing as it was in the original. I feel horrible saying this, but in both films it looks like a half-rape half-sex scene between Amy and Charlie like she sorta wants to do it but doesn't at the same time. Not very feminist of me, but you can't deny that this scene is a little weird because I can't tell if she's giving in out of fear of more physical pain or because there's still some feelings there for Charlie. Anyway. One thing this movie does wrong is the end battle where some of the killings are too stylized and not realistic at all - the nail gun and the bear trap, mostly. Also, the movie takes too long to get to the exciting parts and has too many characters, when the story should have centered more on David and Amy and the hooligans.
For work we had a Halloween party and had to dress up as a movie character. I chose to be Alice from the Disney cartoon version of Alice in Wonderland. This costume was actually made on the evening of Sunday October 30th, the night before Halloween. I must say I am impressed that I finished this! For this costume I used McCall's 4948. Materials wise I used 4 yds of light blue moleskin that has been in my stash for years, 5.5 yds white Kona cotton, 3 yds 1.5" wide white satin ribbon, 6 yds of 1/2" horsehair braid and 1 22" blue zipper. I made a few changes to this pattern. First, I added a collar to the neckline since Alice's dress has one. I also added .5" in length to the bodice and took off 4" from the skirt length. I redrafted the back of the skirt using the pattern from the front so that the gathers would be more even throughout the dress. Lastly, I added a couple of layers of the cotton for and underskirt to match Alice's but also to give the dress a little more fullness. All layers of the skirt were then hemmed using the horsehair braid to give it the wavy look. I love this costume! So much so that I am kinda sad I will probably only wear it the one time.

Typing out the quote above, I wondered if I'd discovered the secret to Chris Christie's rhetoric. It's a rule of 3. Say something once. Then restate it with the same key words, but in a somewhat different order. Then say it a third time, carrying over some key words — e.g., "America" and "next 5 weeks" — and add on one new thought. (Let me know if you see other examples of what I'll call The Christie Rule of 3.)

I went upstairs to kiss my son goodnight and told him that when he woke up, his baby brother might have arrived. He was very excited! I took out my gifts from my Glasgow Blessingway, my bracelet and labyrinth and crystals and lit the candle a good friend had given me. I got in the bath around 9.30pm. The contractions were the same but I just felt like having a break and knew this early on that they would most likely stop.

Tullian grew up in a loving, nurturing Christian home. All through his life, he never doubted the existence of God, never disbelieved in the authority of the Bible and the reality of Jesus and the cross. He just simply wanted to have fun and live his life the way he wanted to live it without anyone telling him what to do. His great fear was if he surrendered his life over to the Lord, God would strip him of all of the fun and excitement that this world has to offer.

And this is my problem. He said all the right things. Complimented me on my clothes, my perfume, and talked about the next date, and the date after that. He mentioned that I should go with him to a festival abroad at the end of June, and he was a perfect gent all night. He carried my ridiculously high heels for me and found a club for us to go onto where I’d feel comfortable in my back up flat pumps. He didn’t take me to a pretentious place either. It was in fact a converted public toilet underground in west London and the crowd was most definitely eclectic. I caught him staring at me when he thought I wasn’t looking. He paid me random compliments in the middle of our conversations. We laughed, we talked, we danced, we kissed, we…well. Enough of that. But now I’m stuck. The thing is, I like him (obviously). I mean, I like him in a ‘thinking ahead’ kind of way. And I have no idea what the ‘dating rules’ are.

From the time John J. Macreedy steps off the train in Black Rock, he feels a chill from the local residents. The town is only a speck on the map and few if any strangers ever come to the place.

It's apparent that the locals have something to hide but when he finally tells them that he is there to speak to a Japanese-American farmer named Kamako, he touches a nerve so sensitive that he will spend the next 24 hours fighting for his life.
I blog specifically about food allergies too often (although it really is layered into most of my posts) but I feel inclined to do so for a few minutes with Halloween right around the corner!
I'm liking the added splash of citrus to the bathroom because it ties in the bright colours from the rest of the townhouse. Right outside the bathroom (impossible to photograph because the tripod won't fit in the narrow hall) are my needle felted wool abstracts.
The editor offered a contract within days. And she said nice things, calling it "stellar writing", and how much she loved the characters and the high adventure. You know. The stuff that makes an author feel all warm and fuzzy.
Enter Gabe. A, then 25, tall curly haired guy with fantastic blue eyes. His profile, if I remember, somehow mentioned both his proclivity towards cucumbers and social justice. Obviously, I emailed him right away and we soon found ourselves walking along the building-treetops of the highline in Chelsea. Though our view of the world was spot on, I just didn't feel the love that night and we parted ways.
In South Africa, these are more commonly called gumboots.

Shortly thereafter, Hurricane Reality hit the shoreline at the ex-agency and 16 people lost their jobs. My instinct was still intact apparently. Any fantasy I'd harbored of returning, or kicking myself for leaving in the first place, quickly evaporated. To be fair and honest, there is no such thing as the perfect job environment. When I would sit down and imagine everything I didn't like about the ex-agency, it suddenly made the current agency look pretty good. (Big perk: no electronic time sheets to fill out.)

On its formation, the LeT joined the seven-year-old anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan, an armed insurgency directed and supervised by the ISI with funds and arms supplied by the CIA and the Saudis. Once the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, the Army of the Pure turned its attention to a recently launched anti-Indian jihad in Indian-administered Kashmir and beyond. The terrorist attacks attributed to it range from the devastating multiple assaults in Mumbai in November 2008, which resulted in 166 deaths, including those six Americans, to a foiled attack on the Indian Parliament in New Delhi in December 2001, and a successful January 2010 attack on the airport in Kashmir’s capital Srinagar.

i’m not holding my breath that she may change her mind after cooling down. if she does, cool. if she doesn’t, also cool. we’ll both move on.
I’ve been e-mailing a Covenant of the Goddess officer, and just a few hours ago I received a response back from her, stating, “The Covenant doesn’t train for clergy. We trust that the coven belonging to the Covenant will train but to be honest, I find that most of the training is one person who is not and has never been clergy, training someone else. The training is usually spotty and frankly most professionally trained clergy in the larger religions don’t really recognize these credentials.” Which, you know, seeing as this is a spread out religion with no central bureacracy, so to speak, legitimacy is extremely hard to establish. Going through the Unitarian Universalist Church would basically be the best option, but to be endorsed, you have to be a UU and be involved in the congregation, of course. So, you know, crap! Plus, I’m not quite sure what it is about UU, but I just don’t particularly like it.

On my first visit in 1981 I ordered a bowl of chili with toast. First of all I've always been accustomed to eating chili with saltine crackers and the accompaniment of toast seemed odd to me. But what I got was just right. The chili was robust in tomatoey chili powder flavor, but it had a sweetness that balanced any spiciness quite nicely. I had never tasted a chili with that amount of sweetness and I was pleasantly surprised. The buttered toasted white bread made the perfect companion to the chili.
The New York Times’ decision to disclose the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, a robust and classified effort to map terrorist networks through the use of financial data, was irresponsible and harmful to the security of Americans and freedom-loving people worldwide. In choosing to expose this program, despite repeated pleas from high-level officials on both sides of the aisle, including myself, the Times undermined a highly successful counter-terrorism program and alerted terrorists to the methods and sources used to track their money trails.

The Solar Eclipse of Sunday, May 20th, represents a powerful time, taking place in the first degree of Gemini and thus sextile to the Aries point. Mercury rules the sign of Gemini and is found in Taurus, in conjunction with Jupiter and in aspect to Saturn and to newly retrograde Venus. Both thought and emotion are brought to the fore and in combination, granting you an unusual opportunity to come to a better set of ideas concerning your earthly situation. Since Venus is exactly trine Saturn, your love-life and relationship energy is inward and somewhat stifled, but intensified. In addition to the important relationships in your life, you are seeking to concretize as well your dreams and your artistic impulses.

I really wanted to have Vertigo on this list, mostly because it’s my single favorite Hitchcock film. Jimmy Stewart gives simply an awesome performance as the troubled and almost creepy-obsessive main character. And the plot, with its hints at ghosts, dopplegangers and an all around unhappy ending really had me struggling to overcome what I knew was true. Vertigo is a sublime example of a richly textured psychological thriller, not a horror film. It pained me to do so, but Vertigo is out.

In February we had a set back (that became a huge step UP if you understand how He works in His amazing timing) and were told that our home study could not be approved until we both underwent full psychiatric testing due to our backgrounds and histories. Ok, we can handle that – no biggie right? Yeah, not so much. Knowing what was in our history made the process very nerve-wracking. Neither of us had any idea what to expect and although I had seen counselors off and on my whole life, I never put much faith in their answers or recommendations. This time was very different. As our wonderful Christian psychiatrist explained, the tests were designed to find problems. Everyone who has ever taken these tests, could arguably have something wrong with them. She showed us the results while trying to reassure us that it wasn’t to tear us down but to make us aware of things that we could improve upon to better ourselves and our marriage in the long run. Unfortunately, my husband and I both internalize criticism, no matter how constructive or how positively spun it is, and this knocked us both down a bit.

Rob Kardashian- started with a lacklustre waltz. It was slow and pretty, but I think by the end he lacked the focus to keep his carriage and lines in full form. The judges though, were not so harsh giving him all 9′s to start with. His Freestyle was a real tribute to Cheryl Burkes genius. It started off graceful, and ended with booty shaking and energy. It was definitely a culmination dance… a dance that showed Rob’s transformation and skill level. Like at a recital, you give it your best shot…and that’s what Rob did. Kudos to Cheryl, it was a great Freestyle with tons of great moments and super high scores.

Abdoulaye Faye bagged a late equaliser against one of his former clubs to give us a very valuable away point. Stoke did well to come back from 2-0 down after the first half with Big Mama getting Stoke’s first goal following a Fuller pass. Why we started with Cresswell and Danny Pugh who knows and once Ricardo Fuller & Glen Whelan (his free kick provided the Faye goal) came on we were all over Newcastle. The Delap throw in seems to losing its effect as well as the season progresses and Sonko seems to have a big throw on him, although his come in high and are easier to defend than Rory Delap’s powerful, low angled throws.

As Narcissus is the figure in the above who has received the least attention or mentions in previous posts, perhaps some time should be spent elaborating upon him now. He does also appear alluded to in Hadrian’s Thespiae inscription, where the temple of Aphrodite and Eros is described as “beside Narcissus’ flowering garden.” In Marguerite Yourcenar’s book Hadrian’s Memoirs, she has a scene in which this inscription and its connection to the meeting of Antinous and Hadrian is beautifully recounted.
Yes, I love the freedom that comes with living by myself. I am the supreme ruler of the thermostat. I feel no shame in sliding into bed at 5a.m. or waking up at 2p.m. Hell, I can dance around in my underwear to bad 90s pop if I so choose. But, all the same, every so often, I am reminded that being independent isn’t half as wonderful as having someone to push you to go running in the park when it’s raining or half as much fun as having an argument about someone burning shrimp pasta at 3a.m.
Hey, I never considered myself a Don Juan but in simple terms, if that car could talk many of the stories associated with those activities would be rated “NC-17.” Since I need to cover all the bases and I will not make any further comment about it but I have researched the issue and the statue of limitations has run out on anything else that might have happened during that time.
At this point Mike decided that the Sat-Nav was leading us astray.
According to Tichy, this approach succeeded because it involved the leadership of the company. This led to high expectations in the participants, cultural definition in the company, and strong tests and clarification in the leaders. All this resulted in a cultural dimension in learning which requires clear values and a stated vision that provides strength to development activities. Most learning happened on real projects (action-learning, 80-20 approach) and was geared to the right timing (career transitions) for max impact.

This is analogous to the public humiliating by Maulana Mufti and a talk show host of Veena Malik for her candid moments with Ashmit Patel on the Indian reality Show, "Bigg Boss" - a virtual flogging of sorts for public consumption - which she brought upon herself, according to the rape myth, because she acted like a slut.

I’ve also recently decided that when you live in a beautiful area, it’s important to get out there and enjoy it even if opportunity only allows short trips. And so it was that Andrew and I found our way to the coast for four days of California beauty and adventure.
We decided early in the game that the en-suite was to be moody/dark glam...a good counterpoint to the bedrooms pretty glam;)
This morning, two men stood in the same courtroom where they were convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced to life in prison for a rape and shooting that happened almost 30 years ago. This time, both were smiling, as they were one step closer to exiting the criminal justice hell that consumed the last three decades of their lives.

Locally, since being well beaten in the general election, her profile has been low. Wednesday’s appearance in the chamber for a full council meeting was the first time since June 30 that she had turned up – and her ability to claim her allowance for council duties was in jeopardy had she not turned up for the November council meeting.

Even the very Prussian Wilhelm II ("Kaiser Bill"), who is often seen as the man who started World War I, saw part of his duty as German monarch as being to represent the interests of ordinary Germans against the influence of the middle and upper classes. This was a significant part of the reason behind his much decried dismissal of Bismarck as his Prime Minister in 1890. Bismarck was of course a "Junker" (landowning Prussian aristocrat).

You want to talk about cool, how cool would it be to give sight to the blind. If you have the pure absolute truth in your pocket, it would be better than any set of glasses or contact lenses ever made. The truth would help the blind to see. You are telling me that is not the kind of stuff that would blow up the ratings on a reality show! What a reality that would be, to travel from town to town and give people who are blind the gift of sight. Are you telling me, if you could do it, you wouldn’t? I know I would. That is how cool it would be to be in the center of the truth. I am not there, but man would I love to be there!

It was at the latter institution in 1908 that Harpo Marx joined the Marx Brothers. Well, obviously he joined them when he was born, but this is when he joined the act. At the time, the act was a singing act called the Three Nightingales, and consisted of Groucho, Gummo, (the brother who never made it onto film) and a kid named Lou Levy. Harpo and Chico each had separate careers playing piano in saloons, whorehouses and silent movies. Apparently, on one occasion, the boys’ mother Minnie, who did the booking, booked them as a quartet at Henderson’s Coney Island. The theater wanted a quartet so she said the group was a quartet to get the booking. In his autobiography, Harpo Speaks, Harpo writes of being grabbed by his mother right in the middle of playing in the movie theater and dragged out to the gig. Harpo couldn’t sing. He was petrified, and by his own account, he wet his pants.

It wasn't until I became a mother that I understood. It wasn't until I struggled to achieve my impossible dream of being there for my daughters in every way they needed me that I saw the truth. It wasn't because my mother didn't trust me or love me that she worried about me so. It was because she never wanted me to be hurt. She never wanted me to fall down. She never wanted me to know the pain she felt, out there, in the world.

Prior to any shoot, I visualize my images. I do not set up a repetoire, but I think of the images that I definitely want to get. So, in light of the fact that we were going to be on a cruise ship, on the ocean, in beautiful Long Beach, I imagined some beautiful pictures OUTSIDE and great natural lighting inside. I am not a wedding photographer, so I was especially mindful of mentally preparing for this as I wanted these pictures to be perfect for my friend. I had all kinds of wonderful images . . . in mind.
I cut my Evanovich teeth on the numbered Stephanie Plum novels, starting with ONE FOR THE MONEY. As of November, they’re up to EXPLOSIVE EIGHTEEN. It was always fun revisiting hapless New Jersey bounty-hunter Plum, her sidekick Lula the ex-hooker, her nutty Grandma Mazur, and her TWO love interests, Morelli the cop and Ranger the mysterious high-tech security consultant. The books are hysterical in places, sexy in others, with a comfortable level of nail-biting. Nevertheless, somewhere around ELEVEN ON TOP I stopped salivating and started just picking them up sporadically whenever I tripped over them. As I said, that’s easy to do—they’re everywhere.

Dear fellow bloggers and readers, it’s been wonderful 5 months of cooking, photographing, writing and sharing. I’ve learned so much, and I keep learning new things every day through countless wonderful, delicious and creative ideas I find in your blogs.
Grits continues to believe larger macro trends having little to do with the justice system account for much of the recent crime decline for both juveniles and adults. After all, even if you believe that keeping adults in prison longer (and for lessor offenses) has contributed to the overall, long-term crime reduction, that doesn't explain why juvie crime is declining even more rapidly. I often wonder if one of the biggest factors may be the rise of the internet, cell phones and video games, which occupy an extraordinary amount of youths' time that in my day would have been spent running the streets with much more potential for getting into trouble. The kid playing Grand Theft Auto IV for hours (or for that matter watching porn) is at home staring at a screen, not out jacking my car, spraying graffiti, burglarizing my house, etc.
While the left is surely motivated by hate - I mean, nothing could be more obvious, they want to do nothing but destroy - is it bigotry to question Mormonism? To wonder whether, all things considered, a president who is Mormon might be a problem?
On the recommendation regarding very well-that means buddies or advisors, people often include a key phrase from the obit announcement for example, “In place of blossoms, efforts might be shipped to…” Certainly, the majority of individuals sincerely value all individual movement involving support and may later on are sorry for possessing an inadequate number of blossoms for the funeral. A far more correct term for many people may very well be, “Together with blooms…” or maybe, “Advantages loved for you to…” Make use of ideal thinking, although remember this “in place of” lingo is often meant to encourage kindly products rather than warn various other expressions. Stylish fellow feeling blooms happen to be proper together with non-profit supplying. Check out that: Funeral directors

Don’t get me wrong, having goals and wanting success is not a bad thing. What I am talking about is our discontent or dissatisfaction with what is happening right now; you know, that thing we had wanted to achieve so very much, before we actually achieved it.
In the next version of the script, I’m going to try and have a relevance filter pull out posts that are over two months old (so we’re dealing with *recent* posts), as well as some which simply don’t belong in “Biblical Studies.”
I find it kind of odd that I spend so much of my time in the basement, writing and whatnot. It just seems to be very boring. I suppose if I had the money and the ambition, I could take the vlogging and blogging along to some of those crazy things that go into the Wishful Thinking theme. But, I don’t know, this just seems a bit boring. Maybe I’m just not doing it the right way. Or, maybe, I should just make the most of what I’ve got, because there’s no point in not playing the cards you’re dealt. Play the game!
They sent me a link to their bandcamp page where you can listen to everything they've ever done. Toxicbreed's Funhouse recently posted their entire discography, so I've provided those links. Hopefully they don't mind me giving all their shit away.
Alas, BART doesn't cover the entire town. Two breweries you'll need to ride MUNI out to, along the N-Judah line or various buses, are Social and Beach Chalet. Social Kitchen and Brewery is where brewmaster Rich Higgins whips up intriguing and approachable beers (try the Rapscallian, a Belgian Golden that pairs with just about everything on the menu). That this neighborhood spot is two blocks from many attractions in Golden Gate Park is a bonus.

What’s wrong here? Muhammad is referred to as “the Prophet”, with no qualifiers- he’s not “considered to be a prophet by Muslims”, or “the prophet according to Islamic believers”. No, he’s “the Prophet”. Might that be confusing to a young student?

Of course, more can always be done to promote Australian authors. Internationally, for example, we should be including writers in events such as the ‘G’DAY LA Australia Week and ‘G’DAY NY Australia Week promotions in America. Authors could also be sponsored to attend literary festivals to promote Australia and their works.
But here's the rub. There are a lot of cooks out there that are smarter, more talented, and far more driven. And they didnt stay up until 5am last night doing coke. They don't drink on their shift. They are so singularly motivated to be the best, to move up, and move on that with every hangover you get, they're leaving you behind. Think about the crew at Alinea, or Laundry. How can there be room for the fog of a big night out when you have a 15 hour day and the standard of perfection weighing on you?
I was tempted though. Because I’d already witnessed the power of the GAD Fastpass at work, and I was NOT afraid to use that puppy. But for some insane reason, there is no actual Fastpass line in Disney’s restaurants. Yet. Chili’s and Outback, yes. Only it’s known as “Call Ahead Seating” and it brings me almost as much joy to pass up 20 suckers trying to share one long upholstered bench as it does to pass up a line of suckers waiting in the Stand By line at any one of our favorite Disney rides.

(Moving down two spots) Tied for 19.) The Muppet Show (Seasons 4 and 5) – From 1976 to 1981, master puppeteer Jim Henson brought his Muppets to television each week in The Muppet Show. The show has been so popular, that it catapulted Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang into movies, as well as a number of other tv shows and specials. Disney acquired the rights to the Muppets in 2004 and had originally released seasons one, two and three. Then, despite Disney Home Entertainment announcing season four at the D23 Expo in 2009 for release in 2010, it and season five have yet to be released.

Have you been asking God what He is going to do? He will never tell you. God does not tell you what He is going to do— He reveals to you who He is. Do you believe in a miracle-working God, and will you “go out” in complete surrender to Him until you are not surprised one iota by anything He does?

Heat up non stick pan to brown the brinjals and long beans. Turn to medium low heat so that the brinjals would cook slowly until they turned soft. Put the brinjals and long beans aside. Pour a little olive oil on the pan and sauté the garlic till it turn golden brown. Add in soya sauce and a little water. Pour in the brinjals and long beans. Add salt to taste. Serve with steamed rice.

But Fetching breathes new life into the story by arming Olivia and her friends with dog training techniques of revenge. Not only is it funny, but it was fascinating seeing how Olivia took the lessons she learned from her dog trainer grandmother and applied them to her peers. The best part is, those techniques totally work and Kiera Stewart described the results of Olivia's efforts exactly as they would happen if this were a real life experiment.
My own kids – no. They are teen boys and my fifteen year old can’t stand romance. “Mum, why do you have to spoil a perfectly good story right at the end?” is his regular complaint. They do read them in proof though and are very loyal and supportive (apart from about the kissing).
Now, take a look at the Dragon Chow Dice Bag. The first thing you will see is that all of the dice are in the bag. You will also notice that the bag is standing tall, and the bag will continue to stand tall even if the ties were not pulled tight. In my interview with Lyndsay, she stated:

Lyrics for MY BACK PAGES by Bob Dylan
I tought we should have a girly one this time.
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
Since our couple hate each other and are sick of spending so much time together, Eun Jae devices a plan to end their relationship. How about she gets injured while saving his life so that she’ll be admitted to the hospital forcing him to get a new bodyguard? So they go to some abandoned building in her hometown where she’d hit him with a baseball bat and then somehow get herself hurt. The moment she bashes him in the back, some dude sees the door open and locks them in. Then slapstick jokes you can see coming from a mile away start to happen. Like they can’t get cellphone reception anywhere but outside the window so she climbs on him and stretches her hand outside and of course she drops her phone. And then he suggests that she try to climb out of the window and she gets stuck. I’m so shaking my head at the things one has to do for an acting role these days.

Eryn might be the single witness, if only she'd wake up! I clamped my lips together and threw my voice, "Eehhnnnn!"
Last month, News International took the controversial step of withholding its monthly ABCe figures for its entire portfolio ahead of Times Online erecting a paywall next month. But despite the move, News International “continues to work with ABCe” as members, under the proviso that its sites must be publicly certified at least once within the next year, as stipulated by JICWEBS – the UK committee that defines the auditor’s standards.
I wanted to make a real quick card today to send to my friend. Every summer she does something really fun, like going to Las Vegas and just staying in a hotel for a week. She usually takes her laptop and just sits by the pool and play all day. Then, she will go to the casinos at night and play most of the night! LOL
GOOD Friday. And it has been, so far. Matthew has the day off from classes, so we started out the morning with some puppy cuddles, fresh fruit, and delicious everything bagels from Central Market… and we both agree that these particular renditions were the closest we’ve ever had to our beloved New York bagels. Almost felt like we were back there in our favorite little cafe, watching the world bustle by.
The 5-year ARM was unchanged from last week’s average of 2.85 percent (0.7 point). A year ago, the 5-year ARM was 3.47 percent.
Anyone else ever taken the Real Age test? Mine is 29.6 (my actual age is 35.4). Sounds good, right? But there are a few…issues. First off, who designed the nutritional analysis and why do they think it’s still 1965? They ask you to estimate how many servings of various vegetables you get per week, but offer only about 10 to choose from. OK broccoli is cool, cabbage sure, but where are all the other options? What about eggplant and zucchini and snow peas and bean sprouts and yams and…So they end up telling me I don’t get enough veggies, when I eat a couple of servings of veggies for both lunch and dinner. Do I need to start adding broccoli to my breakfast now?
"The sexual cells of the 'tetraploid' form of a plant will, therefore, contain twenty chromosomes, i.e. the full number characteristic of the original diploid variety. If a tetraploid female hop is crossed with a diploid male, the cells of its progeny will contain three sets of chromosomes - two from the tetraploid female and one from the diploid male. They are, therefore, called 'triploids'. As they contain a full complement of chromosomes from the female plant, they will have a very much greater chance of resembling that parent. Dark proposed in this way, by using disease-resistant male plants, to produce disease-resisting varieties closely resembling existing varieties in their other general characters, but, because triploids are usually sterile, containing less seeds."
Come noon and the Arkitrekkers were 80% finished with the building. The kids from Albi's village had come out and watched with curious fascination as the Arkitrekkers raced against the clock to get the building done.
By accepting the FREE gift of eternal life by believing and loving Jesus Christ our transgressions become nothing in the shadow of the glory that God would love to reveal through us. But, it starts with a choice. We have to decide whether or not we will receive Him and His gift. God won’t force anything on you. He simply desires that you take what has already been offered to you. He has offered us so much joy and love and peace that it amazes me. Hebrew 12:2 simply tells us to lay aside every sin that easily besets us and look to Jesus. That’s the key. If we keep our eyes on Him and we follow after Him we’ll find ourselves inherently not sinning.

With our third child, we ended up supplementing our covers with wool soakers during the daytime, with long leg cuffs (make sure they have leg cuffs - or you may be the victim of the dreaded poosplosion). We had already loved Aristocrats as bulletproof nighttime soakers for the older two children, but they don't come small enough for a newborn. In addition, I bought three of the cutest fitteds ever for our youngest. I sold one and only have the tools and sailing prints left. My father instilled a love of sailing in me and I couldn't resist.
I haven't had one of these in a long time. I should go find someone who would be willing to purchase these for my use.

So to achieve your business’s goals, do what people do when they’re just sitting around: yack. Tell each other stories. Connect on a visceral level. And form relationships. That’s what social media is all about.
Western art has been so much influenced by Mediterranean cultures, and by the Renaissance – and so relatively little by, let’s say, the bracing floes of the North Sea and the Baltic. William Morris and several of the pre-Raphaelites, yes. Wagner, yes. Tolkien, yes. T. H. White, I suppose. Auden himself. Who else – of the first water? Very soon one’s having to scrape around. And yet, we British are of the north-west European world. It’s in our bloodstream, our nervous system, our language, our laws, our landscape, our stories… And so, for obvious and subtle reasons, the myths, legends and sagas are likely to speak to us.
How large is large? Well, when it rises on May 20th on the East Coast of the U.S. it will be right near it’s minimum distance of 221,457 miles and will show a disc of roughly maximum size – about 33′ 30″ in diameter.
There were about 20 ‘maybes’ that we then had to re-read and some of these made it onto the Yes list, some different, so we ended up with 30 stories. But it’s also down to taste and we tried to be as objective as we could be in our selection which is why several readers works well and then the final selection will be read by our final judges and shared until we find a winner, runner up and what stories will make it into the anthology. Then we also think about how they fit together as a collection as well, but the whole time looking for something strong, well-written and that gripped us.

There is a living tension, a line running between what can be achieved and what we cannot do.
Here is a close-up of the image. I can't find any challenges to enter this in. Everything I tried there was something that didn't meet the requirements. Oh well. The copics used are:
The cover and illustrations by Jim Kay beautifully evoke what’s going on in the story. They go right to the heart of things, but good luck trying to describe them.

In Vancouver there is an amazing shop on Granville Island called Maiwa. I discovered it last summer when we were there, so made a bee-line there once again. Twice in fact. It would have been more, only the family already knew what I was up to! The supply store is a treasure trove, filled with all sorts of goodness to get the textile creative juices flowing; be it knitting, crochet, felting, sewing, painting, natural dyeing or printing. It was the latter two that had me transfixed mostly and I thought it may be of interest to you, too.
I couldn’t help but feel this
This tag was done with my copic makers--I sprayed the tag with bg05 and layered some sequin waste on top of it. Then, I used R27, Bg05, and e44 along with my airbrush to spray some tyvek. I then melted the tyvek to create the texture. (To get a better idea, you really should click on it, it's hard to see well in this size.) I then cut out the heart and colored it using bg0000, bg01 and bg05. I spayed the bird (a stencil from Coffee Break designs) using bv25. I went back with my blender and dotted the bird to create the polka-dots. I outlined the dots using my spica pens and did the outline/tree using my multi-liner. The white at the top is the copic opaque white.
After a quick look round the shops, it was on to the River Ness Islands walk. This is a lovely circular walk along the banks of the Ness, passing over picturesque bridges and islands in the water, with distant views of the city. The weather was warm and sunny and it was very enjoyable.

H - Let’s pick up on something we spent a long time discussing when we started this blog: our decision to post our first-draft comics pages here. This is primarily a “making of” blog, examining the process of creating a graphic novel (aimed at readers interested in “creative process” issues as well as comics fans) – rather than the kind of comics blog where a final story is presented in weekly installments. Because of this, we spent a good while debating what we should post here by way of comic pages, since normally one doesn't publish first-draft work! However, we realised early on that in order to discuss the ‘making of’ our novel, we'd need to introduce some of the characters and plot lines -- otherwise the blog would be full of story references that readers wouldn’t understand. It would become nonsensical!
I am currently staying at home as a mom for the next 9 weeks, but on October 6th, I go back to my regular job as a Senior Assistant to the VP of Marketing of a Pharmaceutical Company.. not what I went to school for but I LOVE my job.. I get paid very well as an assistant and my boss completely rocks.
This is the only ultrasound I will be having, Lord willing. As much as the curious, technology loving part of me would love to go for an elective 3D/4D sono (Have you seen those things? They are creepy/cool.), the conservative, natural side of me won't allow it. Much as I'd love to see her pretty face again I don't care to subject her to another ultrasound.
A Tornado Warning is issued by your local National Weather Service office (NWFO). It will include where the tornado was located and what towns will be in its path. If the tornado will affect the nearshore or coastal waters, it will be issued as the combined product–Tornado Warning and Special Marine Warning. If the thunderstorm which is causing the tornado is also producing torrential rains, this warning may also be combined with a Flash Flood Warning. If there is an ampersand (&) symbol at the bottom of the warning, it indicates that the warning was issued as a result of a severe weather report.
then i might have stayed up till 5 after. dealing with friends. you know, being a good one.
Story: It's a decent story line. Ragnarok has already taken place. In order to save Asgard, the god sacrifed themselves and created Grim Angels to conquer the invading demons who came from Utgard. Asgard is saved, Utgard is remaned Riviera and is now the safe haven of the Sprites, and the gods left everything to a council of Sages. A thousand years later the Sages learn that demons are back and send two Grim Angels to activate the "Retribution" which will destroy both Riviera and the demons. That's where the game starts. Fairly early on there's a plot twist where the main protagonist is stripped of his memories and sent to live with the Sprites. This is where the actual game and story line kick in. I won't give anything else away, but the rest of the story steadily gets better.
A couple of months ago Vicks hosted an blogger event to feature some products to help moms get through the cold and flu season, such as their Behind the Ear thermometer, cool and warm mist humidifiers and inhalers. We're coming out of the cold and flu season now, but their tips on getting the most out of your humidifier is more relevant than ever during allergy season, so I wanted to share them with you:
Let there be no doubt – if you ask me, this new Gintama was a lot more fun and had a lot more of good moments than the previous anime series, when looking at it relatively. I loved the Kabukicho Four Devas Arc, which was one of the first – the scenes were beyond godly. The action and the way some characters acted in that arc, can only be described as "badass". I think it was then that I realised just how awesome this continuation of Gintama was. When it comes to the humor, it was even more enjoyable than the first series – and truthfully I don't know if it's because I've warmed up to Gintama's crazy humor or because it's just really funny.

Before I knew it, the years flew by, and it seemed I had very little to show for it. I began to feel trapped by my job, yet I didn't know what else I could do. I wanted more. I wanted a creative outlet. I wanted direction; I wanted purpose. I wanted to commit myself to changing the status quo.

After the establishment and formalization fo the covenant in Ch 10, there came the difficult work of repatriating the City of Jerusalem. It was one thing to rebuild, but it is another thing completely for the leader to inspire those who had established lives elsewhere…to pick up and return to the City of Jerusalem.
The Bible defines faith as substance and evidence. It is more than just a set of beliefs, it is the essential element which gives us clarity and certainty in the promises of the Bible. Is is foundational to the truths of God’s Word and without it we cannot even begin to know or please God.
On going to bed that night, Joseph began thinking about Zuleikha and couldn’t stop thinking about her, and he couldn’t sleep.
Look, I’m not averse to those types of movies; in fact, some of them I much like, but it’s so refreshing when a movie like Our Idiot Brother comes around that it’s warmth and earnestness kind of washes away just how problematic some of the film is. There could have been a lot more here, but that would have required the filmmakers to extend the film’s running time, and I think of one of the film’s great strengths is its ability to drop us right into this family and allow us to bask in how everything just seems normal and comfortable for this family and then to know when to call it quits; it’s so rare for a comedy to clock in under two hours these days that any comedy that is short almost scores immediate points in my book. But there’s more to the film than that. All of the archetypes are here for Peretz and company to revel in their quirkiness a la Wes Anderson or the coldly mock their idiosyncrasies a la Noah Baumbach or to paint the portion of New York that the film takes place in an unflattering way so that we laugh at how silly these hippies and tight-asses are instead of understanding where they come from. Now, that last part makes it sound like Our Idiot Brother is up to a lot more than it really it and even though it may not be that type of movie, it’s one of the best movies to be released under the usually off putting title of “Sundance Movie.”
Necessarily, seekers receive every sort of channeled messages, often short but recognizable. They describe the voice as passing onto their ears, or they are audio messages.
The chapters in the present are narrated from Kinsey’s perspective. The ones in the past are presented through a variety of narrators, providing the reader with both an inside and outside view of the crime. Because we view the events through multiple points of view, we judge for ourselves the characters’ motivations, and become intimately connected with the resolution of the crime. And, as Marilyn Stasio suggests in her New York Times review of the novel, “by alternating Kinsey’s brisk first-person narrative with dramatic flashbacks that catch the spirit of the town during its volatile post-war period, Grafton allows Violet to emerge as a dynamic but dangerous life force – irresistible to men, threatening to women and too reckless for her own good.”

Once David and his wife passed away in 1786, his nephew Abel stepped in to raise their nine children. That may seem crazy now but back then it was quite normal. Around 1827, Abel K. Conklin, Abel’s son, inherited the house after his father’s death and made a second story addition to raise his family. He later became the Town Supervisor, Justice of the Peace, Commissioner of Highways, Assessor and Commissioner of Common Schools. Abel was an important and busy member of Huntington society which eventually rubbed off on his son Moreland who served as Executive Chairman of the Committee.

I had previously purchased a brace to hold my knee in place for the run, but at mile 2.5 my knee gave out and the pain was immense; however, I carried on. I knew I was so close to the end and I actually ended up being one of the first finishers across the line! I paid for my choice to run for the rest of the day and even today it hurts to walk.
A character integral to The Avengers, Nick Fury, was brought to screens in 1990 in a television movie titled Nick Fury: Agent Of Shield. It starred David Hasslehoff as a retired Nick Fury, who is brought out of retirement to stop terrorist organisation Hydra from releasing a virus that will destroy America. Being a television movie, it suffered from budget limitations and the casting of many televison actors that gave clichéd performances, but still managed to find a small audience, most likely loyal to Hasslehoff and who were glad to see a (somewhat) faithful portrayal of Fury brought to the screen.
My first holiday abroad was in Benidorm in the days before it was a TV series.
“Two and a half years!” he snarled back. “I gave up so much for you – I gave up football, I stopped playing for the academy when I could have turned professional so I could be with you more, I’ve done everything you wanted for two and a half years, and one hand on your tit is the furthest I’ve got, how the hell is that taking advantage?”

One of the questions analysts asked Apple's CEO Tim Cook during the financial results call yesterday was for his views on the future for a converged device such as a cleverly designed notebook pc that can also be used as a tablet. Analysts and many parts of the media just don't seem to understand that it isn't about what it's possible to build (however cleverly). It is about the user experience. Time and time again this mistake is made by forecasters and pundits. Within Apple, it is ingrained corporate understanding.
Fourth thing was that my bond with two of my friends became strong but you know when bond increases there is always someone that gets jealous or feels insecure about it and issues arise,but still strong bond is there and I hope everything gets cleared out soon between everyone.Well this fourth thing was about my nice experience and nothing about the learning stuff.
My Pros - It's published from a company I have come to welcome in our home learning library, and it is filled with a biblical world view. I feel it is easy to use and it would be a wonderful way to introduce the periodic table. This book is non-intimidating, and very user friendly, easily capturing the interest of the home learner. Chemistry seems interesting to me now, and that is saying a lot since I dropped out of Chem in high school... after three days. Looking forward to finishing this book with my daughter!

Because I play old school, the 90′s part didn’t surprise me. The dirty part definitely did. Truth be known, I do play some of the raunchiest music in town: “My Dick” by Mickey Avalon, “The Whisper Song” by The Ying Yang Twins and Missy Elliot’s “Work It”. I just never saw it as a genre. I play nasty music because women dance to it.

Exercise is important for circulation too. In fact, it is equally important for long-term good health, because if you let your circulation and the condition of your blood deteriorate too much, there is a chance that your legs will not get enough energy to carry you around and then toes and feet begin to suffer.
One thing that I always find difficult about watching the movies of books I have loved, is that when I read, I tend to picture what I am reading in my head….It is almost like I am the director of my own personal movie. I create in my mind what the scenery and characters look like (with the help of the authors words) and I imagine the words coming to life.

So Puck enters this race, and she's mocked and treated a joke. It's a man's race. I love the fact that Puck doesn't really care about that. She's doing what she has to do, because she needs to win. I admire that she knows that people are going to think what they're going think and she doesn't need their blessing to prove to the men that a girl can win the Scorpio race.

Neural Network is a personal favorite. It’s one of those paintings that I wasn’t sure of at first, but it keeps growing on me. And I’ve always loved the little lens lights inside it and the way they activate one by one in rows as a viewer walks across the painting. Here it is in neutral photo studio lighting and then below that in a retroreflective snapshot.
They might well experience a rise in immigrants on their way here. How will they distinguish their origin? How will they tell the difference say between a Somalian for example who has arrived in Holland for a short time to become eligible for entry into the UK as an EU citizen? Or a Somalian that has lived in Holland for a good few years and just wishes to relocate to the UK?

I really enjoyed the first movie and was impressed how much it got to me. Especially considering how Jack Black can annoy me sometimes. For the sequel I was happy to be drawn back into the world, and liked getting to know the characters all over again. One of the problems with some voice acting is the audience can be taken out of the movie with higher profile celebrities as they try and match face to voice. However in the first movie and this sequel
The film has had other titles over the years -- Island of Death, Death is Child's Play, Lucifer's Curse, Los Niños, etc. -- but Who Can Kill a Child? is apparently the original one, and is the one used on the 2007 DVD from Dark Sky Films, the edition I watched. It's provocative, but it's also perfectly accurate for the movie.
I took myself off away from my friends, and sitting on a rock, looking out at the sea, I tried to get my head around what had just happened. I wanted to go home, but didn’t have any means of doing so, and what good would it do anyway. My friends started to drift over to me, “Enjoy this break in Harrys’ memory” one of them said, which is exactly what I tried to do.

The more I discover new bands via the internet, the more I become aware of the fact that most music affectionados have a very Eurocentric view. This holds especially true in the metal world so it has become a mission of mine to spread word of bands that are off the radar. Today, I am exploring another project that is very dear to me named Qafas (meaning “cage” in Arabic). The one responsible is Learza, a musician from Bahrain, who has had his hand steeped in several one-man oriental black metal projects since 2004. He has taken a different approach with this one; the project is an experimentation with funeral doom as his medium. This holds especially true for Qafas' 2010 EP, “Al-Ahlaam,” which literally translates to “The Dreams.”
Oaken Barrel is one of the many Indianapolis-area breweries that have expanded sales through the use of bottling and outside distribution.

Anyway, if you have a Cryptic account and have had it prior to December 2010, you need to go over there and reset your passwords there NOW. And if you made the mistake of using the same password across multiple platforms, I’d reset THOSE too-and make them different from each other. Cryptic’s screwed you over already once with this issue-no sense in allowing that error to be compounded.

So once you’re over the fact that the Fast and Furious film franchise is getting another instalment, it’s time to analyse these casting rumours that are doing the rounds. There is no doubt that this series of films are highly entertaining despite all of the films being pretty much the same. And whilst the films manage to pull in a huge audience thanks to their continuous ‘fast cars and hot women’ model that they follow and also throwing in the eye candy for the women, it seems as though they are aiming for an even wider fan base with Fast and Furious 6, or Fast Six, or The Furious Six or whatever it ends up being called.
I can see why people drop their cases sometimes. I ended up with a stipulation in our divorce that neither of us would come into contact with the other or try to contact each other or communicate with each other. That is all that I ever wanted – hard to believe that it took a year of negotiation to get to what I was asking for all along.

Cline continued to thrive in 1961, and gave birth to a son, Randy. On June 14, 1961, she and her brother, Sam, were involved in a head-on car collision on Old Hickory Boulevard in Nashville, the second and more serious of two during her lifetime. The impact threw Cline into the windshield, nearly killing her. Upon arriving, Dottie West picked glass from Patsy’s hair, and went with her in the ambulance. While that happened, Patsy insisted that the other car’s driver be treated first. This had a long-term detrimental effect on Ms. West; when West was fatally injured in a car accident in 1991, she insisted that the driver of her car be treated first, possibly causing her own death. Cline later stated that she saw the female driver of the other car die before her eyes at the hospital.

I could take this to so many different levels, and go on and on (nothing new…!), so whilst you are thinking about how to best keep yourself (myself) from dipping to those depths, below are some simple tactics to safeguard your (my) mental health – it is not a magical list, but certainly helps and can be applied to our everyday life to help keep our mind, and subsequently our body and soul in good health.
Additionally, legitimate capitalism, which is the financial backbone of America and has been responsible for the success of our great nation - not its downfall, has been purposely demonized by its merger with crony capitalism. Crony capitalism is the incestuous bonding between business and government, the use of influence, inside information, and other illegal and immoral activity that enriches those in government and private individuals. It is this intentional merging of legitimate and crony capitalism that obfuscates the problem and provides a layer for protection for the crony capitalists themselves.

While Psalm 22 is read by Christians as foreshadowing the crucifixion, this future hope of restoration should not be ignored. By the time of Jesus’ ministry, Israel had endured hundreds of years of exile and domination by Gentiles. Many longed for the Messiah, they one who would finally liberate them from these “wild animals” who encircled them. Psalm 22 is one of the few places in the Hebrew Bible which combines the idea of a “suffering servant” with that of a triumphal Messiah.

The ugly truth is it's the spineless parents who parade their undisciplined children around like royalty that make people dislike kids.I think the truth is even uglier: It's the parents who expect their children to behave perfectly all the time who raise people like Granderson, who apparently can't stand children. I think that deep down inside any adult who hates children must be a child who was raised to hate himself.
Journalism's rules account for some of the awkwardness in phrasing. We can’t call it "murder" or call Charles Stuart the killer, since he wasn’t charged and didn’t confess. So what’s the most economical edit that makes the report accurate? Is there a neater solution than "pleaded guilty to helping conceal evidence about the killing"?
When I'm walking with Arch, I feel safe. He might only be a pup, but he's a big boy. We walk (or rather, I walk and he bounces) the streets of our town, sticking to well-lit areas that we both know well. The local hoons serenade us with wheelies and burnouts, and the train boom gates send their melodic ding-ding-ding through the still night air. As we make a wide path to miss the local pub, the delicate sounds of yobbos having a ball at the TAB echo across the way. Dogs howl, brakes screech, the Woolworths sign glows like a neon god.
Okay, so they’re not the best animal in the world, they’re kind of expensive and they’re relatively small, but for a source of meat that is sustainable and easy to get hold of, they are very hard to beat.

Studying English language and literature is different again because my mother tongue remains the strongest and my capacity to read more widely and deeply is not tempered by the constraints of comprehension of the language. The world is full of stories and every one gives me a better understanding of this earth and man and why I am here. My Open University course has forced me to read books I would never have chosen and like some bad tasting medicine that has done me nothing but good. I am currently writing an essay on “The Burial at Thebes” by Seamus Heaney (based on Sophocle’s ‘Antigone’). I would never in my life have picked up a classic if I were not studying and I would never have come across this quote by Seamus Heaney ‘I once said that the classics are like the longitude and latitude of consciousness in the West, they establish the first lines of thought and feelings.’

I felt his fingers slide inside me, twisting, scooping around, seeking out the buttons that would turn me to jelly. At that moment I went down on him hard, sucking him deep into my mouth and throat, my tongue sliding around his shaft. Tasting him. Breathing him. My fingers were working around his balls and the base of his cock and I detected a shudder just before he came… I was no longer aware of exactly what he was doing to me, I only felt waves of pleasure radiating from deep within me out to my arms and legs, pulsating across my belly, filling my breasts with tingly heat, rippling up through my shoulders and neck to my head… Even my hair felt energised.

The German folk in a life-and-death struggle; Fortress Europe standing up to Anglo-American imperialism at great cost…” and every day, the long casualty lists.
Unrelated to the winning jockey of the 1937 Grand National who bears the same name and also hails from the Cowbridge area, Evan Williams was born on April 3, 1971, on his family’s farm in the village of Llancarfan in the Vale of Glamorgan. He used to get up at dawn to milk the cows before going to school. He took over the running of the farm full-time when he was 17, concentrating firstly on dairy farming and then beef when the price of milk dropped. He also started training a few point-to-pointers in 1997 but the foot and mouth outbreak of 2001 decimated his herd and restrictions on the movement of livestock wiped out the point-to-point season. Williams sold his cattle at a loss after the outbreak and went to Ireland to buy 18 horses with the proceeds, going on to be champion point-to-point trainer and jockey in 2002. He took out his full training licence the following year and rode his first winner, Cherry Gold, in a hunters’ chase at Chepstow on April 22, 2003. Williams enjoyed his first big-race success at the same course in December of that year, when saddling Sunray to win the Finale Juvenile Hurdle at odds of 40/1. The winners continued to flow and Williams shot to national prominence with State Of Play, who followed up success in a handicap chase at Aintree’s John Smith’s Grand National meeting in April, 2006, with victory in the Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup at Newbury seven months later. The chaser has since gone on to triumph in the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby in October, while other big race success has arrived courtesy of High Chimes, who gave Williams a first Cheltenham Festival winner in the 2008 Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup Handicap Chase, and Grade Two scorers Deep Purple and Simarian. In the 2009/10 season, Barizan emerged as a top-class juvenile hurdler, winning a Grade One at Punchestown after finishing second in both the JCB Triumph Hurdle and in the Matalan Anniversary 4-Y-O Hurdle at Aintree. Williams is assisted by top amateur James Tudor, who was champion point-to-point rider in 2007 and partnered High Chimes to his Cheltenham success. He is married to Cath who continued to train point-to-pointers after he took out his professional licence, saddling over 50 winners in two seasons including the prolific Cannon Bridge, who chalked up nine wins in a single campaign. They have three children William, Isabel and Ellie. Evan is the son of former amateur jockey Rhys Williams. John Smith’s Grand National Record: 2009 State Of Play (4th); 2010

Several of my books would not work as e-books. The Marilyn Monroe Treasures and Celine Dion: For Keeps are the most obvious-- they're gorgeous, oversized gift books filled with beautiful photo layouts and removable memorabilia in vellum envelopes. How am I going to get a removable marriage license into a Kindle? I'm not. And I'm not even going to make many sales on Amazon of books like that-- those are books that people have to see in person to appreciate. They have to walk into a bookstore and notice the gold foil cover and open the pages and feel the textures and be delighted at the beauty of the layouts and the intimate feel of the memorabilia. I love writing those books. A culture dedicated to e-reading will kill those books.

Simonstern quickly took a step back. The Lord lunged for him, but Simonstern had gained a quickness in an instant. He uncloaked himself to reveal two wands. The one in his right hand sent a fireball to the Lord, pushing in on his back. The guards instantly ran over to defend their leader, only to see the second wand summon a dire bear right in front of them. By the time the Lord got up again, another fireball was sent to knock him down.

I was out all day Saturday, with some of my plans for the day coming through and some not. I spent the morning and early afternoon at a huge art festival in Brooklyn. From there, I had planned on going to a smaller art exhibit also in Brooklyn, but the trains made it difficult. It was partly my fault; I probably could've left DUMBO a half-hour earlier (that's Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass to you non-New Yorkers), but I was enjoying the day too much. Still, I had to take a completely roundabout trip to Greenpoint because the trains that would've gotten me there quicker weren't running normally. I knew when I got off the train that I wouldn't have had any time for this show, so I reluctantly chose to blow it off and head to Jersey City for the highlight of the day - a return to the Landmark Loews Jersey Theater.

4 Fareed Zakaria writing in Khaleej Times that America is the most dynamic society in the developed world. While Japan has entered and Italy and Germany are approaching a demographic death spiral, the US remains young, vibrant and active. Demographics is not destiny, but it helps mightily to have a growing society, with a healthy share of young workers — who are also taxpayers. US still attracts the most immigrants and most investment in the world.
Much better. My intention was to artfully slice the chicken breast and place those slices in some fancy pattern in the sauce and photograph the whole thing in the light box.

We have a duty to support all peoples against oppression. Where a people seek to argue for their own self-determination, we have a duty to support their right to put forward that case, free from intimidation and aggression from other states, but we have no absolute duty to support such a demand ourselves. On the contrary, where the interests of the working class internationally are weakened by such a struggle we should say so, and argue against it, and for workers unity across borders.

This bedroom had about forty trash bags filled with clothes. There was a male cat in the room that they didn’t even know was in the house. He had urinated all over and the smell was horrible. The sacks covered a water-bed, and I was scared the first time I caused a ripple and all the trash bags started moving. I thought there might be some giant worm-like creature nesting underneath the bags. In the corner I found some computers. One was open and filled with a liter of kittens that didn’t make it.

Since she got home, Frank and I have learned some new vocabulary. An "emo" is a goth-like person who is full of emotion. "Nu Ma Nu Ma" is a bouncy song, in Romanian, that is evidently all the rage. And "skeet" is a bad word. (Hint: MJ cracked up when, during a conversation yesterday about Grandma and Papa's upcoming hunting trip, Frank made a passing comment about "shooting skeet." When Frank said it, it meant firing a shotgun at a clay pigeon. The teen meaning is a good bit more sexually explicit than that.)

Brown sugar cinnamon tortilla chips. Yummy yummy.

Cook time depends on how 'done' you want them to be. I want mine slightly golden around the edges, and mostly crispy. Using corn tortillas will give you more of a Dorito crisp vibe, whereas flour is usually a little chewier. Since they're dessert chips,

I'm going to start this review by saying something outrageous. Who nees family or friends, hell, who needs food when you can lock yourself in a room and immerse yourself in the wonders that are the Soul Screamers series? I'm exaggerating, of course, but that should give you some idea as to how much I really mean my love knows no bounds when it comes to this series. No review I could ever write would ever come close to expressing how much I adore this series, and specifically this book (but I'm going to try!). If I Die surpasses My Soul to Steal, and I thought that was brilliant! I'm going to say something now I never, ever thought I would say. Are you ready? Ok, here goes. I love this series more than I love the Shifters series. I know! The Shifters series was absolutely phenomenal, and I didn't think Vincent could ever write anything that came close to how amazing it is, because how can you beat perfection?! Guess what? The Soul Screamers series is better!

Rich and Stu were in Huddersfield but they had sent up some of their Human Cannonball up for us to try. It's a big old beast weighing in at 9.2%ABV. It's Double IPA which means that it's had the hop volume turned up to Spinal Tap levels. And it's very drinkable. Very drinkable. It's chock full of loads of North American hops and has a sweet kick to it and a strong, pungent aroma that reminds some of cat piss. Others, such as Brown, of "damp dishcloths". For some in the room, it was their first experience of such a big beer. It was interesting watching peoples reactions. Some were instantly taken by it. Others, slowly won over by it.

Then the bomb hits. Then they are all betrayed; then James and Lily die at Voldemort’s hand, Harry is entrusted to his relatives, and Sirius is led off to Azkaban. It’s a completely different situation from the Vietnam War, and yet the tone of Goodnight Saigon strikes me as fitting. Going crazy. People getting killed around you. Holding on to the few you can trust, and leaving more of your childhood behind with every day. And when Sirius escapes, attempts to clear his name, rejoins the Order, and goes down in battle against Bellatrix Lestrange, I think the playlist goes from An Innocent Man to Honesty to Only the Good Die Young.

That’s what happens to smokers. While they do incur higher medical costs than nonsmokers in any given year, their lifetime drain on public and private dollars is less because they die sooner. “Smokers die early enough that they save Social Security, private pensions, and Medicare” trillions of dollars, said Duke’s Finkelstein. “But mortality isn’t that much higher among the obese.”
Blogger was very good to me, and being a Blog of Note in 2008 gave me a taste of what the wider world of blogging was all about. It inspired me to write more, share more and try to hone my skills with storytelling, idea generation and even be cognizant of good old-fashioned grammar.
Just finished a novel. It’s a psychological thriller along the lines of The Silence of the Lambs except a lot scarier. Probably the most scary book I’ve ever read. I found myself both strongly desiring to put it down and continue reading at the same time. The writer is to be commended for causing such a cognitive dissonance.
I used to be a big fan of Lisa Germano back in the ’90s. There was something indefinable about her haunting, catchy music that struck a chord with me, and I had great affinity for her remarkably confessional (and frequently very funny) lyrics. Mainly, though, it was her voice that first caught my attention. Soft, measured and unaffected, with a barely-discernible Midwest twang, hers was the slightly cracked sing-song Voice Of The Prozac Nation. If you asked me in 1995 which female musical artists Rock Division were my all-time favorites, I would have obviously answered, "Number one: Kleenex/Lilliput," but Lisa ran a close third or fourth, right after Poly Styrene's consumerism-obsessed X-Ray Spex and—I'm almost embarrassed to admit (after all, it being 1995)—Huggy Bear or Bikini Kill, both of whom I stubbornly believed were about to rid the world of the growling Eddie Vedders (despite ample indications to the contrary).

The artificial colors blue 1 and 2, green 3, red 3, and yellow 6 have been linked to thyroid, adrenal, bladder, kidney, and brain cancers. Always seek out foods with the fewest artificial chemicals, especially when shopping for your kids. Look for color-free medications and natural food products that don’t contain artificial colors like these.
It seemed daunting at first, but over the course of several weeks, I laid hands on 0ver 840 items in the collection and I was able to do a comprehensive physical assessment while I collected statistics. I learned a lot about the fast-paced ebb and flow of a teen collection by looking so closely at these items and their circulation patterns, especially for long-running series like Naruto.
Some yummy new stamps and Spellbinders to play with. Yaah!
Control is a funny thing, isn't it?
Many of these things are already against the law. We have laws against littering, idling, double-parking, and parking in bus stops. Do we really need a permit system to enforce them? Others are just vague and bizarre, like the city should create a pre-crime unit to arrest people before they commit violence. But the biggest complaint people seem to have, according to last year's press release, is that they're messy. Squadron's favorite phrase is that Chinatown is "like the wild west." It's "chaos," Chinatown is being "overrun" with "no clear rules." The proposal would "create a clearer system" that would allow the bus companies to operate "in harmony with the local community."
WHY BRAZIL?
The Spurs opened the 4th-Q extending the 3-0 run they were on, to a 16-4 run that blew the game wide open. With the lead now 21, and Gary Neal hitting everything he's putting up, we look unstoppable, yet again. After a Kings bucket, we had another 5-straight (115-91), and from then on, all we had to do was not turn it over. It was a close one for a half, but our shots continued to fall - even through the final seconds. The 127-102 WIN was simply a second-half domination 69-45 that was too much for Sacramento (or most teams, for that matter) to overcome. Spurs had SEVEN guys in double figures, and no one had more than 17. Here is the boxscore..

I knew from the start that her cake would be carrot cake, but with her recent proclamation of Gingerhood, a little kick from some ground ginger was definitely in order! The ginger also helps add a level of complexity to the flavor of the cake, to play off Emma's internal struggles. In keeping with Emma's polished exterior, I topped the cake with a tribute to her signature bow blouses and throwback hairstyle - a white fondant bow with curled tails.

But now it's September, and a time for a fresh start and a new copybook ready to be blotted. It is time to Be Positive and jolt Penny Dolan's Dire Diary blog a bit closer to what I'd like it to be. So I am creating some new categories. They aren't stunning but maybe they'll help me get blogging more often.
Here is the punch line.
I think I have the only kids in the entire world who actually don’t like eggs. Sure they’ll eat them when I hide them in foods (sausage-bread-egg-cheese casseroles are considered yummy) and will on occasion eat scrambled eggs if I use onions and (really good) cheddar cheese, but a fried egg? Soft boiled egg? A hard boiled egg? There is just no way.

I am going to describe this from the bottom up. I am wearing my dark brown year old Ugg boots of which the right boot already has a small hole over the big toe much to my continual annoyance. My legs are clothed in an old pair of dark blue jeans and my torso is masked by a two year old Mothercare M2B black and grey stripped maternity top. Nice. I really do need some new clothes.

This year, since my father is a gimpy old man and my mother is a fucking idiot with a broken ankle, they didn't decorate the house. At all. A neighbor brought over an 18” fake “tree” and put it on a table where the presents were then placed. That's it. And you know what? The house looks fucking better. If my mother would shut the fuck up and stop crying so fucking often because she couldn't decorate the house, I wouldn't even notice and might actually pay her a compliment about how nice the house looks. But no. All she cares about is the superficial shit around the house that I've been trying to convince
Meantime I join with Sir Robin Bogg in urging all to join the campaigns for NotoNotoAV and NotoYestoAV until both the NotoAV and YestoAV campaigns get much better – but will reserve the right to begin a NotoNotoNotoAv and NotoNottoYestoAV campaign if either falls below the appropriate standard.
Mispronunciations aside (and it’s ree-nuh, in case you were starting to wonder), I grew up very under-appreciative of my name. My name didn’t fit right, but I was a teenager, nothing about me fit right. My sister always tried to shorten it (to reen, yeah, that’s appealing, but if my mother can put up with being called Die instead of Diana, I guess I can muster on under the burden of reen), and my friends tried to hide behind clever nick names: Kit (didn’t catch on), elffy (oh boy, internet inappropriate story there), and of course Sasquatch because I have enormous feet. Nothing stuck. Never did they find a name that worked. To this day I’m not sure if I was relieved or disappointed.
Perhaps the Citizen should ask their readers if they can think of a way to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 without some constituents getting a different MP? I wonder if some of TiG’s sister papers are running ‘Save Our MP’ campaigns?

My belief is that if I eat that breakfast, I will gain weight. She says I won’t. So for one month (until my work conference) I am eating breakfast. We are not tracking weight because I know instinctively I will become competitive. Instead, she will track my measurements. For some reason, I don’t have the same attachment to or drive to reduce measurements as I do weight on the scale.
Have I mentioned that I am a bad globber? I am. I don't take photos of all of the mail I receive and immediately post it. Sorry.
Check cotton fabric. This fabric length is long enough for Cecile to complete either of the above sewing patterns, if she chooses to. It is also light-weight enough for her to wear during La Reunion's tropical Summer, which being in the Southern Hemisphere, she is experiencing now. I had this fabric sitting in my stash for at least six months gathering. We just don't get enough of a sustained summer for me get much use from a garment made from this lovely light-weight fabric. If I still lived in Barcelona, then it would be a different matter... I can't wait to see what she makes!

The difference? In Saward’s run, when the Doctor was pushed to the side or back, his screen time was replaced by the story, or by brand new characters. In what was probably Saward’s best story (as a writer and scriptwriter), REVELATION OF THE DALEKS, he devoted a lot of screen time to the relatively minor characters of Jobel and Tasambeker. They were semi-interesting characters playing out a semi-interesting sub-plot, but they didn’t really have anything to do with the Doctor.

Still the dreaded storm surge of water, pushed in by the hurricane, aimed at the low seawalls of the waterfront, The Battery and the financial district didnt come as high as feared. There was flooding along the water's edge on the west side highway and other sea-leveled areas like Gowanus. Areas of Brooklyn and Queens that generally flood in big storms did again. And trees across the city are being uprighted or collected after being uprooted.
For those smitten with smiles & wrinkle free ties Merseybeat pop crispness meet the dirty & frayed cuff and scarred southern charm of his previous records need not fret. The sound of the men are gone just in name and, with the addition of the occasional electric piano/organ blips and doubled up guitar interplay, the songs sound a bit more fortified and beefed up (in a good way) than on previous outings.
I started by making my favorite Ina Garten chocolate cake recipe. Once cooled baked, I broke up the cake and pulsed the pieces through the food processor in batches. Then I made a batch of cream cheese frosting, mixed it into the cake crumbs, and formed the mixture into little balls. I covered them in plastic wrap, and let them chill in the fridge while I went about preparing the melted white chocolate for the coating.
I teach an Art For Healing workshop that has allowed me to create many process that I share with my students. One of my favorite is to start painting in almost total darkness.

The most important thing to do when writing Chapter One is put your best material out there. Do not humbly introduce your story—present it with a flourish. Don’t hold back! Set your tone and own it. You’re going to write a whole book using great material; have confidence that you can generate terrific ideas for action and emotion whenever you want.
I was in mood for some fast paced action thriller and what better than Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan series books. I became his fan after reading “Executive Orders” where Jack Ryan becomes US president. Patriot Games is chronologically the first book in this series even before “The Hunt for the Red October”. In this book the fight is against Irish terrorist group who tries to kidnap British Royals and Ryan manages to save them. Now the terrorist group is after Ryan and his family and strike against him twice in US.

I played viola with them and guitar, and some small ‘dingly danglies’, and I did some singing also. It was great. múm gave me a fantastic opportunity. I just basically picked up a viola and went on tour. It’s great fun to play with them, this great energy of just ‘doing’. It was my first experience of touring and it definitely added to my music vocabulary somewhere in the subconscious. Nothing that I am doing now is strongly related to the múm experience or anything, but all these collaborative projects provide different ways of dealing with the aesthetics of music. What I particularly liked about múm was that even though it could seem like very simple music sometimes, they were always dealing with very refined aesthetics
When M came back from work, he noticed that his wife was oddly mad. Not mad in the usual sense. Just really wonky in a peaceful way. I told him the wisdom I had gained and he asked me if I wanted dinner from Thai House. I said okay.

Now I consider myself to have great parents and I love them dearly, but there are parts of my personality that they aren’t equipped to help with. It’s taken me 43 years to feel reasonably well adjusted and without God’s help I’m certain I wouldn’t feel anywhere near that goal! In fact I often joke with my kids that if they think I’m bad now, imagined the crappy Dad I’d be without God’s help!
There are two ways by which the Holy Spirit appropriates the physical body of Ka Apaz. The usual way is covering her whole body from head to toes with a white bed sheet. The other way is without any covering when conducting a mass. Seldom is mass a conducted though. Usually, on special occasions only like August 17 which is the true death of Jesus.

Here's one I want to know: why do Patriots fans (and for that matter most of the northeast) hate Peyton and the Colts? Baltimore I can understand (although after stealing the Cleveland Browns their gripe is one of duplicitious hypocrisy), but Patriots fans? I mean the Pats have owned the Colts until recently, and went through the playoffs on Indy's backside. The national media certainly has annointed Brady as the superior QB, and why not? He's got 3 rings, Peyton hasn't even been in The Game. So what's to hate? The Colts are stocked full of classy players and coaches who's only sin with the media is generally not giving anything quotable or controversial.
Perhaps Raghavan would have made it in some other way as his first collaboration with Saif in Ek Haseena Thi bombed at the box office too. It looked like the producer-director pair was not on the same level. So, while Saif wanted to play the part of the I’m-too-cool-to-handle agent, Raghavan tries his best to script out scenes that can make the movie what it truly deserves to be.

In the world of design, there are very few times when you read about someone who is using the power of design to make social change. It was such a privilege to be able to interview Mayura Kona from One Thread Fair Trade, an amazing company that's using textile design to improve the lives of women in India.
The basic racial asymmetry between Blacks and Whites means that the “Face-Saving Racial Myth” must never be challenged, for when it is the already tattered national fabric starts ripping apart. Wherever you have a marked racial asymmetry, honest discussion of it will do two things. First it will be immensely offensive to the disadvantaged race and those who claim to speak for them. This doesn’t mean that they are right, but they can’t help feeling the way they do. They will be well and truly pissed. This is not an argument to placate them. It is just a statement of fact.
OK, today I was able to get 4 LeapFrog Tag books for $6.99. They are buy 1 get 1 free at Target this week but you better hurry because they were already selling out by the time I got there at 11:30am. I also had 2 $5 coupons for the Tag books. I posted last week how to get those coupons. Finally I had a $3 coupon sent to me from Leapfrog.

Since producing this, I got some feedback from a professor I know locally who deals with design. He gave me some suggestions on ways I could easily improve it -- make "MICHAEL" and "HAYNES" be the same width by changing font sizes and tighten up the distance between "GRAVITY'S" and "PULL." Both of those make sense to me and I may do that at some point. It's not hard to upload a new cover. If nothing else, I plan to use those tips when designing future covers.

This morning we got up and Patti had made breakfast, so we had orange danish rolls, coffee & juice, bacon & sausage...It was a splendid morning in Shreveport, cold but nice. We walked down to the dock and looked at the lake a bit before heading out. We got a late start again (left at 10 or so) and it took us longer than planned. We drove pretty much all day, and not much happened, which is probably a good thing when you're on a road trip. Gabe stayed up late last night, but still didn't take a nap. Still, he was an excellent traveling companion once I told him whining was not allowed in the car. We only stopped a few times, but he did much better than yesterday, even though the trip was longer. At about 7, I gave up on getting to Florida tonight. We were both tired of being in the car, and I didn't want to stress about how far we drove. We decided at the beginning that we'd just take it as it came, and get as far as we got, and that would be fine. We have vague goals, but nothing set in stone. So, we stopped in Gulfport MS and got a hotel room.

For me, this case comes right on the heels of reading about the similarly disconcerting execution of Cameron Todd Willingham in Texas under the seemingly disinterested eye of current GOP darling Rick Perry. If you haven’t heard about this case, you should definitely read all the sordid details here. Willingham was convicted and put to death for the murder by arson of his three children. The problem here is that the scientific evidence used at trial was, to be polite, half assed. Several examinations of the evidence, both before and after Willingham’s execution found that there was no credible evidence to support the assertion that arson even occurred. The obvious implication is that you can’t very well murder anyone by arson if you didn’t actually burn the place down.

The vile and pointless things I may write on chat or on a profile which, while profound to me in the inebriated state, are absolutely disjointed and fragments of a booze troubled mind. 2 such discussions took place yesterday evening. Both pitifully rude and intrusive; plain daft.

A sad comment on a life.
We headed out to Hockey for Kade on Friday. After that, we picked up the Flex and headed home to pack in prep for an early morning departure for the south. We stopped in Montague to see my folks and pick up the annuals that I had been hoping to get for a bit. The boys had a good visit. I can't grasp how folks age. I am now thinking about how well I'll be doing when I'm in my mid to late 70s. How well will you do? It's an amazing journey, this life. Anyway, after some time with the dogs, the lovely cat and the chickens and a nice meal prepared and served by a woman who is boarding with my folks (she's working on a special program that places those looking for work in assistance programs and is working around the corner at the Hub) we left Siskiyou County (all the while enjoying the view of Mt. Shasta) and made it to Woodland for the night. The next morning we were off early and headed to Orange County. We checked into the hotel and headed out to visit with my lovely Aunt Mary. It's hard to express how cool she really, really is. We spent a few hours chatting, then headed back to the hotel to sleep a bit. We got up to go visit Mary and Sarah the next morning for a few hours. Around noon we headed out to San Diego so Jeff could get all organized for his conference call the next morning. After that, we headed out to Mandy's house for a bit of a visit. We missed the fun of the craft making, as we were so late, but totally enjoyed seeing many friends. That night we headed out to Flo's house. Flo and family were so gracious and housed us during our stay in the area. Tuesday found us at La Jolla Shores with the funschoolers group. Wednesday we saw our friends Zack, Zayden and Erika; Cameron, Ella and Gardenia; Kade went out with his friend Ryan while the rest of us chilled with Juliet, Camille, Flo and Marc. Thursday found us at Dos Picos Park and the kids got to play Warrior Cats (based on the novels) with the funschoolers. Time in San Diego flew by. We headed out Friday morning to Las Vegas, where we find ourselves today. Last night we hit the pool and the kids arcade and won some fun things. The boys went on the two 4D shows they offered, Sponge Bob and the Extreme Log Ride. We had dinner together in the hotel...we are staying at the Excalibur, and then made the journey to see the Pirate/Siren battle in front of the Treasure Island Hotel. After the show we headed back to the room for some much needed sleep! Today we didn't have to wake up to an alarm, so took advantage of that. The slow pace of waking found Kade and Jeff heading down to the kid arcade again and then they brought us up some breakfast. For the rest of the day we have ice skating, pool time and then the Tournament of Kings dinner show. Sound like fun? It has been. It's way too much for me, though I'm somehow hanging! It's a lot of movement, lights, and noise...along with the interesting vibe that comes with this city. The boys are in hog heaven, though, and are enjoying this experience completely. I'm so happy to be on this journey with them!
Here are two graphs I made with the above data:
2) Last night Sweet Pea had to sleep in the guest room with nobody snuggling her to sleep, etc. I know this is not a good thing, but earlier in the day when she didn't beat the timer getting dressed I had told her she would have to sleep in a different room by herself that night so I had to stick with the prescribed punishment. Even though it was something I shouldn't have used as a punishment because it's something I do want her to learn to do ANYway, as a growing kid. I thought she was going to beat the timer. And I couldn't think of a better idea at the moment that I uttered what the punishment would be.

The second version, written almost in parallel, for the Macmillan Treasury of Nursery Stories, gave me far longer to expand on how nasty the sisters were and how magical the transformations wrought by the Fairy Godmother. The delightful pictures were by Anna Currey, whom I met for the first time only last month, years after we did the book.
And Michael was such a smart addition to the story. As Emma and her band of misfits get deeper and deeper into the world of necromancers Michael’s ability to see and intercede in situations that freeze other characters (literally) is an obvious plus. Because Michael only understands logic (and not the gray area most of our reasoning occurs in) he becomes this walking truth indicator for the group. If Michael sees it, believes it, accepts it…it must be true. Helps to bring a lot of the characters into the paranormal loop fast.

I haven't made a concrete plan yet. It will be a busy week. I'm preparing for my daughter's 7th birthday party and some out-of-town company. So, instead of daily meals and a grocery list, this week I have provided the links to some of my family's favorite squash recipes.
After work, out it came and I patiently made the filling and rolled the dough, perfect rectangle. Yes, it was to be a circle. Then, I spread the filling, another rectangle and came to the rolling the triangles. It went well but with all the oozing, later, the shapes lost something in the translation. I could not care though. These were the most delicious cookies. The oozing cooked up into the tastiest edges (like a lace cookie)
Twenty-six years after I received the diamond ring, I presented it to my daughter on her 25th birthday. A tradition had been born. I waited with great anticipation to pass it on. She waited all her life to receive it. Now it's her turn to pass it on.
I am the surprise star in this week’s selection for Gems from the Web – or, at least, my teapot cosy is! My upstream pal in Knitmas last year was Evin, a.k.a. FreckledPast; and as part of the jam-packed pamper present she sent my way was a fabulous teacosy. She shares the pattern for the teacosy on her blog.
I backed into a doorway and slid down,
Another issue we've dealt with this week is pecking. One afternoon a Barred Rock pullet was bloody as all get out on her comb and head. Turns out it was just her comb. We weren't totally sure how to handle it, but so far what we've done has worked. We grabbed her up, cleaned up her head and put iodine on her comb. We then separated her from the flock. We put Josie's crate inside the chicken yard with some food and water in it for her. That night we slathered an anti-bacterial cream on her comb and put her in the coop to roost. She was all dried up and looking much better by morning. She is still healing with no further assault so hopefully the Rhode Island Red that was bothering her has stopped.
Hey, everybody! My name is Lan Pitts and I'll be your host for this week. I'm a freelance writer from Atlanta (not to be confused with Hot-Lanta, that's something only tourists say) and columnist/critic for the Eisner-winning Newsarama, as well as contributed to various entertainment sites such as Fangoria and Shotgun Reviews. While Jimmy is recovering from his MegaCon hi-jinks, I thought I'd help out with your weekly dose of SEXY MONDAY. Now, Jimmy boy is very proud of this column and it's a very fine way to start the work week off. Him and I have very similar tastes, so I hope I'm on par with keeping this cool, and not end up shitting the bed like Frank Reynolds.
Commercial transactions, he argued, also fostered improvements in moral behavior by rewarding positive personal traits such as reliability, discipline, helpfulness, and friendliness towards one’s fellow citizens. Free trade created better human beings.

My two grandmas and my mom makes the best home cooked meals in the world. I really mean it. Today, I’m going to introduce my grandma on my dad’s side. I’ve already posted several entries about her cooking like (this one), but this is another. My grandma makes food from scratch, everything from scratch, using fresh ingredients. Whenever she gets a phone call from me or my siblings or any one of her 10 grandchildren with a message that we would be visiting her soon, she goes out to the supermarket to shop for the best ingredients around in the morning of our visit. She’s the cutest grandma ever!
I should also mention that each item comes with a different darling vintage looking necklace.
and so i kept them.
Well this blog I have been following for a while called
Fourth, Fight it. Fight with all you’ve got what you’ve targeted, how you understand it and with all your focus.
In this perspectives, what are the power relationships evolving and how they are created?
the answer. God’s answer is to send His Word.
I am sure that they would have “resolved” the issue according to them. I am stuck with lousy network services which will be blamed on my SIM card making me wonder why I ever got a phone like this (which by the way is a pleasure to use!!)
I log on to Skype every morning and this morning it seems my Skype interface has changed a little… Okay not so bad I’ll take some time to squizz through that later (she thinks to herself).
A few weeks ago, I sat down to pray for your mom, your dad and your brother and sister. In the midst of prayer, I suddenly had to ask God “Why? I don’t understand why you create children that have such disorders.” Almost as soon as my mind asked the question, the answer swept over me like a huge wave. Nora, I KNOW why God created you. Without a doubt, I know.
Britain’s educational establishment is similarly dysfunctional. In an effort to promote egalitarianism, the “Conservative” coalition has decided to legally persecute middle-class children by putting the socio-economic background of potential students ahead of their intellectual capacity, thus ensuring a larger pool of disadvantaged students who will subsequently, and quite extraordinarily, be allowed to use iPods “to help them concentrate” during exams.

Today, there was another good reason. The AGM was full of workers from Brough, facing redundancy. Dick Olver made some attempt to set the anti-arms activists and the Brough workers against each other. He suggested that Brough might have remained open had the company received more orders from Saudi Arabia – after the Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) had attacked sales to the Saudi regime.
Ironically, it was the shortest piece of the travels, a mere 500 miles to Fairbanks and back yesterday, that really did me in.

Henri carries the Chest to his room, and we lug all of the equipment into the basement, where he’ll set it up so no visitors will see it. Once everything is inside, he starts placing the cameras and turning on the monitors.

Straight away I had a massive contraction. It was so strong that I got up on my hands and knees (I had been lying on the bed) and swearing, my waters exploded from one end of the bed to the other! They soaked everything within two or three feet.
2. I'm the Slime
The hood came off; I was sat in what appeared to be the cellar of a pub. I heard the rumble of tatty bearded old men walk above and discussions regarding the true origin of IPA and an argument about sparklers. The smell of pongy ale was overpowering. They gave me a pint of dark pongy liquid they referred to as “bitter” alongside a bag of something called “pork scratchings” which appeared to be little more than salted cooked fat. “Get that down you, lager lout” they taunted.
However it wasn't his hand or the word he said that made me bite my tongue. It wasn't even the steely clang of the word when he spoke. It was the look on his face.

Alex's first birthday was probably my hardest day. I didn't want to make him a cake, because I couldn't have any. I didn't want to buy ice cream because I couldn't have any. But the better side of me took over and we bought him a pre-made Oreo cake and ice cream. We invited some friends over to celebrate with us. I didn't get to have any of it. :(
Candy and I were two of the short-listed authors up for the Branford Boase award this week. It's an incredibly prestigious shortlist to be on, honouring debut authors writing for young people and the editors who gave them their chance. Neither Candy nor I won - congratulations to Jason Wallace and Charlie Sheppard who won for Out of Shadows, an extraordinary book about Zimbabwe in the 1980s, which has rightly been recognised already as winner of the Costa Children's Book of the Year, and (judging by the piles I saw on sale at the airport in Amsterdam) has already made the leap to become a crossover title which adults can enjoy just as much as younger readers. The powerful narrative and moral questions raised in Jason's book stay with you long after you've finished it.

One of the things that gets me excited about baking is when someone asked me to bake something for their special occasion, especially for a wedding. At first, the thought of baking hundreds of macarons with my schedule sounds really impossible and each time, I just can't say no for most of them. There is something about wedding that is just so magical and being asked to be a part of that is such an honor for me.
Any other books in the works? Goals for future projects?
Dang we’re good. Sometimes it just takes two heads to figure it all out.
Jeon Kye-soo (sometimes also ‘Gye-soo’ in Romanised form) was born in 1972 in South Korea and is relatively new to filmmaking. He holds a B.A. in philosophy from Sogang University. Inspired by Jean-Pierre Jeunet‘s 1991 Delicatessen to become a director, Jeon initially worked in the theatre, both in the production of plays as well as in script writing. His entry into cinema then came with 삼거리 극장 (Samgeori Geukjang/Midnight Ballad for Ghost Theater) in 2006, a so-described ‘comedy musical horror’, clearly reflecting Jeon’s ties to the stage. Jeon’s filmography is short. It currently consists of three feature length films and one short, with Jeon having dabbled in a little bit of everything: musical, drama and romance.

*I do not believe that the intervention in Libya was primarily motivated by Western thirst for Libyan oil but a serious analysis of the consequences of the intervention must take into account the fact that many people around the world believe that was the primary motivation. Perceptions matter even if one disagrees with them.
Cinematography and sound. They’re like bread and butter, Harold and Lardy, Politicians and dishonesty, their just essential to one another. For sound there isn’t just one example as I’m a strong believer in it making up for half the film. Really you try to watch a film with just dialogue and no score or foley and you’ll get bored pretty quick. On the cinematography front Hero (2002 Dir: Yimou Zhang) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299977/ comes straight to mind. I remember watching for the first time when I was in 6th form and being blown away by it. The shots, the colours, the camera movement; it was just like watching a living piece of art. The film also contains some very notable Chinese actors and the story is wonderful too. Please watch this film. It is a feast for your eyes.
Overall this is an impresssive, classy addition to the numerous Belgian bars around Tokyo (Frigo, Belgo, etc).

Now starting out the book I loved how Harry really did have a normal life. He couldn’t do magic and still had to live with the Dursley’s whom I actually like, frustrated by like. Their attitudes are completly annoying but they give Harry a sense of realiness. Magic is not the only thing. I think that it also really does give more to the plot because it lets you understand Harry more.

This isn't really an awesome post, but you'll have to grant me a few "non-exciting" posts for awhile until I get my blogging back. It's been so long since I've written anything besides a professional email for work...I almost forget how. Maybe I'll be able to re-cultivate my blogging abilities while I'm on leave. We'll see how little Emily does!

My sweet boy somehow managed to turn 3 without my permission. It was met with a great deal of mixed emotion. He was to start a new school district program on his actual birthday. This was finally our chance to move forward with him, and we had (and have) so many hopes for him. But before we jumped into those waters, we celebrated.
This area tends to be one that is always a challenge to figure out. Piles of shoes, jackets, winter gear.... The most unsightly of items, yet a crucial place in our home. Many times, this area just isn't big enough and space both on the floor and the wall is somewhat limited. Which typically requires some critical thinking!
Our oldest daughter went away to college last September. She called just after Thanksgiving to tell me that her dorm window was covered with snowflakes. No, not the real thing, but the ones she remembers from her childhood––paper ones that she spent an entire evening cutting and snipping while sipping hot cocoa.
It is with high-flying expectations that Verizon and Relan are providing you with this re-purposed kite created from Verizon’s own billboards! The kite is designed to be flown and enjoyed time and time again. It is even easy to repair (in case of any evil winds or trees) and comes with a quiver to keep your kite and string in one place. We have also consulted with Professor Kite of the American Kite Association to be sure you know everything you need to know to have a wonderful kite flying experience. So . . . have fun! Enjoy! See you in the sky!

I’ve been thinking a lot about literacy as it is the goal of our school to improve on this area of learning over the next number of years. As a team, teachers and administrators as well as the Western School Board, we hope to take a balanced, holistic approach to improving literacy in our school. Being a parent myself, I thought I would share some personal thoughts on the subject with you all. Feel free to comment as you wish! Thanks for reading, and I look forward to seeing you all at Parent-Teacher Interviews. As always, please feel free to contact me at the school at any time.
My entry this week, of course, is Caden. I literally just teared up looking at this picture, thinking about my boy's special beautiful heart and the miracle of who he is. In case you're popping in from I Heart Faces and don't know the whole story, Caden was born with severe heart defects and had open heart surgery at 5 days old. The three weeks he spent in the cicu at Choa Egleston were the scariest and most beautiful ones I have ever faced. God met us, and encouraged and uplifted us, in incredible ways, even as we surrendered our son.

Then, he began mailing collages to friends and strangers, arranging the first informal happenings. He met and made friends with Andy Warhol, participated in performance art events (1957-1963), staging events, which he called "Nothings."
And then right before bedtime, Kiddo had a mini melt down. The idea of a little green man magically getting into our home while we slept, peeing green in the toilet, changing the color of our milk, and possibly even being trapped in our green bucket was just all too much. Couldn't blame her..kinda sounds like a bad college roommate! So in a last minute effort to keep Kiddo's sanity, but still have fun, I left our pot of gold on the doorstep and left a note asking the leprechaun to please refrain from coming in.
One thing that shines through each time is their belief in each other. Long seen as another weakness – strange that all of the so-called flaws are strengths depending on your viewpoint – the prerequisite of any trophy winning side is unity and trust. That underpins everything; no divided team has won anything.
Someone is watching. He’s a shadowy figure from out of her darkest fears and he hasn’t gotten her.

He’s been waiting. Sophie was supposed to die the first time he’ll make sure that not even a miracle will save her.
I considered using gold leaf sheets but ultimately decided I'd need way too many sheets to cover a surface so large. And I really didn't want a one dimensional finish. It needed to be gold but vintage-y looking so the feather details really stood out.
The truth is that whoever reads their statements, and collects them, and reads the lines and what’s between the lines realizes that they mean Islam, not terrorism. In some of his statements, Bush said that the Muslims are Fascist and deserve a new Crusade. When his advisors drew his attention to the danger underlying his statements against all Muslims, he apologized for them, and so on.

He couldn’t have included “a time to hack and a time to be hacked” (and a time to be hacked off?) in his little list of things that there is a time for, because as far as we know, the internet had not been invented yet. (If it had, those guys did a great job of keeping it a secret! Oh Atlantis . . . ) But evidently, those activities, passive and active, could have been included, because in all my days of emailing and blogging and facebooking, my accounts have never been hacked. Until yesterday. I should’ve known I wasn’t immune.

The third item in the above paragraph has not been true for some time; labor has not been so weak against capital since the 1920s, or perhaps earlier. The authors were writing just before the collapse of the Soviet bloc, a zone that, despite its faults, did provide alternative ideas of social organization. The bloc’s collapse pitched the Left into a crisis nowhere near a solution, opened a previously blocked swath of the world for full exploitation by capital and weakened resistance to the onslaught of neoliberal triumphalism.
I guess it's like most things; a balance needs to be found. Yes, I'm living my dream, being able to write full time.

I was sitting out on the sand in my trunks after angrily refusing to swim during the mandatory practice swim. I had heard an announcement. There was going to be a talent show. One time I tried to participate in a talent show. I had written a song I was going to sing and I began to sing it when stage fright got the best of me. Everyone thought I was cute, but I felt horrible. I could only run off the stage in tears as the next act showed me up.

In the opening episodes there was a certain charm to the wacky high jinks, watching Bridget stumble her way through duplicity after duplicity that Siobhan had left in her wake, all while attempting to find out why Bridget-knowing menacing ethnic drug dealer Bodaway Macawi (whose name-spelling I refuse to Google one more time) or any other number of people were trying to kill her.
As you can see...no cardigan. I actually have to hang my head in shame, because not only is there no cardigan, I haven't worked on it since Wednesday. As mentioned Wednesday, I haven't felt great and working on something that I could possibly screw up that I worked so hard on seemed like a bad idea. So did I work on my January Harry Potter socks instead you ask? Of course not!

This is my ultimate tip. It’s so good, I saved it until last. Follow someone on Twitter and they’ll more than likely get an email saying ‘_____ is now following you on Twitter’. THEN you email them about your band. So they’ll see that you do actually (at least pretend) to care about what you think. Then you can @reply them saying ‘just emailed you!’ or something, and they might follow you back. THEN, when they see you on their newsfeed they’ll remember you and it’ll be a nice subtle reminder of your music. It goes without saying that people are more likely to help you out if they like you, so send them the occasional reply or DM (don’t send them a barrage of tweets asking if they’ve reviewed your music).

Training helps to make the world safer and make friends around the globe. The Russians military needs to learn how to respond to terrorist attacks. Their past responses to Chechen terrorist attacks inside Russia has proved fatal to Russian civilians. President Obama is right to share US tactics with them.

"We've never seen anything like it," he said. The previous high was 858 in 1996, the year after Timothy McVeigh, a militia sympathizer, and Terry Nichols, a sovereign, killed 168 people, the nation's deadliest terrorism attack after Sept. 11.''
Teach them that religion can bring out the best in us--or the worst. Encourage them to explore what is sacred to them--what they most deeply value and care about, what goes beyond comfort and convenience and profit, what they want to protect and cherish, what they would take a stand for, work for, live for.
2. Hydrating in the winter is difficult: This has been an ongoing theme during my training. When its cold outside, I certainly don’t notice the sweat as much, and although I try, I typically still don’t drink enough. I did better this weekend, but I’m still learning.

Where Labour authorities decide to go down the, still as yet unmapped, path of the "Co-operative Council", UNISON needs to adopt an approach of critical engagement which both protects (and asserts) our independent role as representatives of the interests of workers and seeks to push local authorities away from the rocks and rapids of outsourcing towards more fruitful and practical "work streams" of co-production and community engagement.

I opened my eyes with the pain still there but this time I saw more doctors and nurses around. They asked me to PUSH. I tried. I heard myself SCREAM, and I had a feeling that it was not the first nor the last scream! I screamed to them to do something about the pain at the same time that I realized that my request and my pain meant nothing to them. I got nobody’s attention! This repeated many times that I thought it would never end!

Now off to bed after a long night spent around lots of people, because I am truly exhausted...
Symptoms: I kind of over-did it this past Sunday when I spent the entire day cleaning my house and putting up the Christmas decorations. By the end of the day, after walking around for hours, I had the pregnancy waddle down, and my hips/butt/legs felt like I weighed 2,000 lbs. Even though I don’t pull out the pregnancy card often, I have to understand my limitations while I’m pregnant. Hours of hard-core organizing and cleaning are just not possible right now since this baby likes to hang out so low. The constant pressure really takes its toll after a while.
Or maybe it’s always been that way… What are Bush People, you ask?

Although I am from the states I am always pulling inspiration from other countries. England is a popular favorite for myself, fashion bloggers from there always have the best style! Anyways, hope you enjoy!
Incidentally, AirAsia had scheduled a press conference yesterday to address the hike in airport taxes by MAHB, but had cancelled it at the last minute, “due to an unforeseen circumstance”.
I just ask why, if conjuring up nostlagia is no longer a presidence for people to stick with your brand (especially a somewhat redundant brand since smart phones and internet on the go makes any form of crummy search engine pointless), then why not think of new more appealing ways to get customers. You can’t have your cake and eat it Yell. Now i give you props on having a brand identity based off my favourite colour but come on.
The number 10 bus took me on a fairly mazy route through south-west Edinburgh, past Redford Barracks and the recruits on parade and then dropped me off just outside Colinton Village, a well-heeled part of suburban Edinburgh (which, in general, seemed very quiet today). Steps took me down into the main Bridge Street past the Colinton Inn (Deuchars IPA only) and then furthers steps brought me out opposite the Spylaw Tavern a nice sandstone terraced building with a great beer garden out the back with views down to Spylaw Park.

The boat then drives off, carrying the parascender into the air. If the boat is powerful enough, two or three people can parasail behind it at the same time. The parascender actually has little or no control over the parachute. Anyone can parasail and no skill or training is necessary.
Q: Many of my readers are younger, in high school or college, but you and I discussed how hard those first few romantic relationships can be (mine sure as hell were!). Can you share some wisdom about teenage/college-age relationships and what those readers will find beneficial from your book even if they don't necessarily think their partner is cheating on them?
Since I don't have any pictures to share with you right now, I will share a hilarious message we received during the trip from our friend Kevin, who checked on things around the house while we were gone:
This session will cover some of the background of spirits made from apples, peaches, pears and other fruits, and the ways these spirits were historically made and consumed. The session will also explore today’s realm of American-distilled fruit spirits, from the rich character of aged apple and peach brandies to ethereal eau de vie, with an emphasis on the ways these spirits are produced and a look at some of today’s most distinctive distillers of fruit spirits. Panelists will also discuss the use of fruit spirits in cocktails, from classic drinks made with aged apple and peach brandies to special considerations that should be taken when mixing with eau de vie.Location, date, time, etc. to come in early March. All I know for now is that I'll be back in New Orleans' French Quarter this July 25th-29th.

Sure, it’s a drastically different life compared to the incredible number of FCKs in the world. Sure, it’s completely odd to many and impossible to relate to for the rest. But in the end, it’s who I am, and who I am is a man of multiple cultures with the gift of a life that is full of understanding, respect, and appreciation for every corner of the planet.
Medical bills...yikes, but, you know what? Had I been in a country where medical care wasn't excellent, I would have lost my life. I am thankful for good medical care, thankful for a doctor who listened carefully when I knew something just wasn't right, thankful that smart decisions were made and the doctor performing the surgery had skillful hands. We will not lose our home, we will be able to continue to put food on the table, have clothes on our backs. These bills are really just an inconvenience. I'm thankful for the incredibly generous parents who time and time again have shared their treasure with us so that our burden is lighter. I am SO thankful they are a part of our daily lives.
Of course I used a lot more hops than what I grew myself, but I focused the recipe around the Galena hop variety, which I used in both the bittering and aroma additions. I used my .5 oz of homegrown Galena for the aroma addition.
I don't know what Anna would have said here, but I'm going to say Anna was a troubled girl, who made me laugh, cry, scream, and many other things. She was loved by her family very much, and she was very selfish to hurt her family and freinds this way.
Delightful.
In school, we’d call that grading on a curve, and it’s not necessarily a bad thing. As I noted in a previous post, there’s often an instrumental quality to Western narratives about democratization in places like Mali. Looking for exemplars that might inspire other societies, we sometimes choose to ignore or downplay procedural flaws that would raise howls in other contexts. For purposes of democracy promotion, that might even be a sound idea.

Kelly’s Heroes is a simple story. A group of American Gis on occupation duty in a liberated part of France discovers there are cases of Nazi gold in A Bank in a nearby, Nazi occupied town. They launch a full scale operation under the noses of the Nazis and their own commanders to steal it. What results is a good mix of comedy, drama, and action. The film is laugh out loud funny when mocking the absurdities of war and those who cluelessly command it from a safe distance. Not everyone survives the operation. While that adds a dose of reality, it does not ruin the comedy. In fact, the casualties the tension. Said tension is ratcheted up further by bombings, explosions, gunplay, and tank battles which all combine to make Kelly’s Heroes the best action movie of the era.

Teddy Long is being harassed by William Regal, which is hilarious. He then is being harassed by Aksana, who is with another new Wrestler, his name is Antonio Cesaro, who is the former Claudio Castagnoli. Of course, since Teddy is acting like an officer guard, he doesn’t say a word, and Aksana makes fun of him for not being the boss anymore, so Johnny invites them both into his office to discuss the details of a contract.

After some debate, Andy and I decided that for a filling, a lavender-infused white chocolate ganache would be divine. I have to say, the white chocolate may not have been the best choice. I would have liked something maybe less sweet, to complement the light sweetness of the macaron shells. A bittersweet chocolate would have worked beautifully. Overall, though, I am very proud of my maiden voyage into the world of macarons, and I hope to be able to duplicate these results much more in the future!
The storyline is remarkably intriguing and is exceptionally simple. Through the lead – Holden’s aimless two-day wonder, with his unique perspective, attitude and his speech patterns, presents thoughts and psychological feelings of an adolescent realistically. When it was published in the States in 1951, it set off a ‘Catcher’s Cult’ , the reaction from public was polarized – it was listed as a forbidden book, has been selected as teaching materials and also, a novel which millions or more people have read. Holden disliked and tried to resist this hypocritical society, he was unprepared to the world of grown-ups and paid homage to the happiness in being a child.

In one section, about the fat-cat claim that receiving handouts is downright un-American, Wong points out:

Rhetorical Analysis: Other than doing what was required of project three on the LinkedIn profile, the other additional sections that I decided to add was a summary section, a wordpress application and the link to my Twitter. The reason I chose to add a summary to my profile is to offer a little background informatin about myself and to showcase my skills to write about other people (since my summary is written in third person). I chose to provide a link to my Twitter account so that an employer could see how I use Twitter to connect with my audience as well as so that they could get a glimpse of what content and imformation i shared to my network. I decided to add the WordPress application so that anyone viewing my profile could preview my writing skills and abilities by being able to see my WordPress.com posts.
If it were making kids safer, maybe we could overlook how obtuse it is. But a 2008 study found that, in New Jersey at least — where little Megan Kanka, for whom the law is named, was murdered — the law showed no effect in reducing the number of sexual re-offenses or reducing the number of victims.

The problem, as Esman notes, is this: forms of speech that would incite some religious groups to violence would not do so for others. (Note as well that incitement to “discrimination,” a much more slippery issue, is also prohibited).

Forster and Rostami wondered if the officer who answered their call treated all crime victims the same way. When Rostami, who admits she was hysterical, tried to describe what had happened, she says the officer told her to shut up and get in the car. Both said the officer did not record any names of witnesses who stopped to help. Rostami said the officer told them the attackers were "probably juveniles anyway. What are we going to do? Find their parents and tell them?"

Last night, as I stood in front of the Fred Meyer beer cooler, I submitted to a foolish urge: reacting to the unseasonably warm weather, I bought a Lindemans Peche. I love lambics, perhaps more than any style, but I am a cheapskate. The Buddhists say that we are governed by twin urges of craving and desire, and this decision was wrought with equal measures of each.

I have been wearing Agnes’ shoes since rehearsals began. She now has two pairs! The Act I shoes have sturdy leather laces and are a goes-with-everything taupe. But they also have modest heels and decorative scallops; practical but feminine in a quiet way, like Agnes herself. Agnes keeps a pretty tight lid on her emotions. She feels deeply, but rarely shows what is going on inside. And she is proper. Agnes would never cross her legs, even at the ankles. When I see one of my feet, clad in Agnes’ shoes, swinging in the air, I am instantly reminded that I am not fully in character.

Many believe, including me, that Abdullah al-Senussi was instrumental in the terror bombing of the La Belle disco in Berlin in 1986, which killed three people and injured 230, as well as the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which resulted in the deaths of another 270. Also, Senussi was convicted in absentia in France in 1999 for the 1989 terror bombing of the French UTA flight 772, which resulted in 171 deaths.
The Grand Sophy by Georgette Heyer - Whenever I chance upon a discussion of Heyer's Regency romances, the impression that forms is of Jane Austen methadone. This isn't entirely an alluring description--it conjures images of an author who replicates the frothy surface of Austen's novels without dipping into the acid that lies just beneath it. In my first foray into Heyer's writing late last year, with Cotillion, that is indeed what I found, but Cotillion was also charming, effervescent fun, and its central romance was satisfyingly human and unsentimental, so I marked Heyer as an author worth returning to. Though it shares some superficial similarities with Cotillion--both novels involve a young woman arriving at the home of her fashionable London relatives, rearranging their lives for the better, and sweeping her dashing cousin off his feet--The Grand Sophy may not have been the ideal next step. For one thing, the novel is just starting to gear up for its home stretch, as the title character, who has been raised by her rich, eccentric diplomat father to be his hostess and housekeeper and has been shocking her relatives with her strong will and independent habits, starts seriously meddling in her family's affairs and scheming to separate her cousin Charles from the odious, mean-spirited prig he's become engaged to, when an evil Jewish moneylender turns up. Sophy's confrontation with, and ultimate triumph over, this character (for which read "agglomeration of ugly antisemitic stereotypes"), is one of the most viscerally unpleasant things I've ever read, but even so I might have managed to enjoy the novel around it if were not also at around this point that the novel's central romance begins to teeter.

First spot to go was on my hip. Didn’t feel a thing. I got an enormous bandage that sort of looked like perhaps a rabid animal had bitten me. Maybe even a shark. I was an enormous baby by the end of the first day. But, the following day it was fine. I removed the giant bandage and replaced it with a little teeny one. I skipped the gym for a few days, haven’t been swimming in 2 weeks and have been going through hydrogen peroxide like it’s going out of style.

There aren’t a whole lot of similarities between Ikemen and HanaDan on the surface.

In socialist society there will be no social stigma attaching to any kind of work. Nor will there be pressures, such as exist at present, to continue - because they are cheap and therefore profitable to the capitalist -industrial processes which are harmful or dangerous to those engaged in them. In any event, with human needs and enjoyment as the guiding principle, there will be no need for anybody to be tied to the same job continuously. The opportunities for men ands women to develop and exercise their talents and to enjoy doing so will be immense.
I mentioned that I arrived at the show late. It runs from 10 a.m.-4 p.m., but I almost always get there around 12:30-1 p.m. That's so I can avoid the big mob scene for whoever is signing autographs that day. (Yesterday it was former Syracuse great Floyd Little. I care nothing about SU, and yes, I know Little's history).
Sleep habits: I still have frequent 3 a.m. insomnia sessions. It seems like this is my witching hour. I also go to sleep very early these days. If Anna cooperates, sometimes I’m in bed by 7:30/8 p.m. It’s a little pathetic. Maybe if I can force myself to stay awake until at least 10, I can avoid the witching hour at 3 a.m.

When and what we eat may affect our nighttime rest, if not our tendency toward bad dreams. A small study published in the International Journal of Psychophysiology had a group of healthy men eat spicy meals before bed on some evenings and compared their quality of sleep on nights where they had non-spiced meals. On the spicy nights, the subjects spent more time awake and had poorer quality sleep. The explanation is that spicy food can elevate body temperatures and thus disrupt sleep.

And second, the definition of “choice” in this public dialogue seems quite limited. Yes, there are those who do or don’t have the liberty of choosing whether or not to work inside or away from the home. But I think we often overlook what the work itself means to us. I am grateful to do work that I love. I feel for my friends who feel stuck in a job, sometimes a life’s career, that they perceive as pure drudgery. They count down the hours until the workday ends and the years until the work ends altogether–they retire from a company or their children head off to fend for themselves.

Obviously, America is not a post-racist country. The blurry line dividing the other two appellations — racism and racialism — is crossed daily in overt and subtle ways. The line’s vagueness and the sometimes inadvertent crossing of it reflect the very different American experiences of blacks and whites. The recent shooting death in Sanford,Florida, of unarmed, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a self-appointed neighborhood watch captain, for instance, was seen by many blacks as another instance of racial profiling. But feelings of outrage and sadness and a demand for justice crossed all racial borders.

As far as a weekend update, I don’t have much to report. It was HOT here, and I stayed inside in the AC and got lots of much-needed grading done. I got some walks and gardening in, and I got all my grocery shopping done for the week. Prepared and ready for the week. I’m looking forward to being out and about more next weekend, because it’s overdue.
I don't think I've much else to tell you. I had my wisdom tooth removed and good riddance to it!! I have a nice, big hole where my lousy tooth was, but it's closing up slowly and all the pain has gone which is a great feeling after having it niggling away for so long. My health visitor came and turned out to be lovely, which made a very nice change from the Health Visitors From Hell that I've had along the years. We've had leaky pipes in the bathroom, leaky skylights in the big room and a bit of a condensation and mould problem in the bedrooms (thankfully rectified with extra radiators), so a bit of a soggy fortnight since I last blogged, but hopefully, we're drying out. Conor and I are working our way through the Series One Downton Abbey DVD and I'm enjoying it so much that I don't want to watch it, because then it'll all be over! (you can tell what kind of desperate, hoarding child I was when I was little, can't you!) I think I've fallen in love with Mr Bates in fact. Ah well, there are worse crimes and with Billy only seven weeks old, I can play the old 'hormones' card for some while yet!!

It all fell into place for me. All life contexts are equally empty, so any life can be “perfect” for our spiritual life. I could be spending all of my life working to cause the Dharma to flourish but still grasp at it as being inherently ordinary, and for me I will be living an ordinary life. Or I could live a completely normal life with a full-out career and family, but relate to that life as my spiritual retreat and training ground, and that is exactly what it will be. The original name I considered for this blog was “life as retreat” to reflect the (near) complete resolution of all contradiction in my mind between my external normal life and my internal spiritual life. My life, as it is, is my long-term spiritual retreat.

Given that the BFP currently claims 724 members, has its own website, is supported by a number of bloggers, possesses links with the EDL and has been covered in the national press (e.g. The Independent), should not the expectation be that it ought to fare better electorally than a party of circa 60 members that possesses a rudimentary website, no supporting network of bloggers and has zero visibility? Well, such a party does exist, and it is called the Democratic Nationalists. Despite the fact that to all intents and purposes it is invisible, its five candidates clocked up the following results on Thursday (the first three wards being in Bradford, the fourth in Doncaster and the fifth in Pendle): Royds - 453 votes, 15.1%; Tong - 276 votes, 11.5%; Wyke - 313 votes, 9.6%; Stainforth and Moorends - 410 votes, 16.6%; Waterside - 92, 7.8%. If the Democratic Nationalists could achieve this, why did the BFP poll even more abysmally? The DNs even managed to beat both the Respect and Liberal Democrat candidates in Wyke. Overall, the DNs averaged 309 votes per candidate with a 12.1% share, whereas the BFP equivalent figures were 51 and 1.93%.

He was probably a wagon, coach or carriage driver. Marion's Showell ancestors were agricultural or brewer's labourers and farmers, so it seems likely that this man drove a wagon transporting farm produce or supplies for the brewing industry in Burton.

5) Here we see the real intent of this capitalist lickspittle - blame the poor, the unemployed and the diabled for being poor, out of work and disabled and then remove their benefits. In other words whilst the bankster scum who Simpleton supports, and who he has been sticking his tongue up their arses for years, grow rich on the Bankster Welfare State Billions handouts from the government - he wants the poor to be denied benefits.
Co-Hosted Daytona 500 party for 50
I say maybe 10 minutes later, I make a return trip to the stand. I was going to ask the list runner what size of table was needed next. All of the sudden, the same lady returns, all huffy and puffy. She interrupts a new group, that is trying to get onto the list. She starts stammering something I couldn't exactly hear due to noise that was in the restaurant. I finally make out enough of her babel to find out that like half of her group is leaving. She only needed a four top now (which actually made it possible for her to have the very next table).
When was the last time you told your daughter, she looked great? Or your wife? Or your mom? Makes me feel great when I hear it and I almost certainly smile.

Not much else in terms of structures or mechanical parts were evident at the launch. Lowe did confirm to me that the Mercedes AMG KERS remained packaged under the fuel tank in one assembly. Also adding that there would not be an significant weight loss to the system. As a significant reduction in weight was made between the 2009 and 2011 season, via the consolidation of the Batteries and Power Electronics into one unit.

The show continues until May 24th, when the Equal Opportunity Draw will determine who will own each of the more than 45 original pieces. If any of the artwork does not have an intention to purchase form in it’s draw box after the public drawing, it will immediately become available on a “first come, first served basis” for a very limited period of time.

It’s a simple-illustrated header with a very clean white background which is in contrast with most of my previous headers which are in darker tone and backdrop to correspond with my blog’s black theme. So, this new header in white captures much more attention, and I would like to highlight the fun of blogging to my blog’s readers through the use of playful font of words and arrangements in the design. Those words scrambled all over in one piece on the right side of the header are all associated to ‘blogging’ that reminds people that ‘blogging’ is more than what it is actually. That whole header kind off represents my mind, full of stuff, which is a bit kinda messed up. But then, there is one huge portion of white empty space in that header that represents part of my mind, of what I see, of what I hear, of what I smell, of what I touch, of what I taste, and in overall, of what I experience, that is being brought out (cleared out) of that header and presented through my posts below. This kind of symbolism sounds great, right? Haha…

Monkey arrived shortly after I posted yesterday, and J got home not long after that... We were playing around and having fun before dinner, and Monkey was running through the house. He was running full tilt in the living room when he tripped over his tricycle and face planted into a speaker. Of course, the corner of the speaker hit him right in the mouth. He was on his knees with his hands over his mouth, and I grabbed him up. When I was finally able to pull him away from me long enough to look at his face, I saw that he was bleeding. Lots. Not scary amounts, but mouth wounds bleed a lot.
With this in mind, we constantly pray for you, that our God may count you worthy of his calling, and that by his power he may fulfill every good purpose of yours and every act prompted by your faith. We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

As far back as I can remember I played with Barbies. My absolute favorite thing to do whenever I got a new Barbie was to remove her from the box and promptly restyle her hair and give her a new outfit. As a result of this I had a bad habit of loosing or misplacing many of my Barbie's outfits and the majority of my Barbies were doomed to end up in a jumbled box with a number of other naked Barbies whose clothing had gone missing.
Kate's father walked out on her family, got remarried (after cheating on his first wife with wife number two), and had a baby. Kate hates visiting him but does it anyway and actually kind of bonds with her baby half sister (emphasis on half is totally Kate's).
3) Rosie Visits the Sitter - Rosie has spent 2 whole days with her babysitter, Kathy. She has done wonderful so far and I couldn't be more pleased with how she has adjusted to her. She loves playing there like a "big girl" and even naps well there, which I was worried about, since she is in a "different" place. She will start going to Kathy's full-time in August. Even though I LOVE her being at Mimi's, I have a good feeling about her being at Kathy's, too. I'm sure I'll post more when she starts going full-time... stay tuned!

Whitney Houston fans all over the world were stunned by the sudden, untimely death of the 48-year-old superstar singer in February. The official cause of death was listed as drowning brought on by the effects of heart disease and cocaine use. Her public struggles with substance abuse are well-known and were acknowledged by Whitney herself. Regardless of what led to her death, Whitney leaves behind a musical legacy and valuable lessons about self-worth.

In his post he mentions a wee girl with a lazy eye. Now, when we are kids, and more likely than not into adulthood, we always have something that we don't like about ourselves. Something we feel hinders us in the popularity stakes. I remember a ginger haired lass at my primary school that had cheeks that were just so white and round that I used to have daydreams about stabbing them, I don't know why. Admittedly, she pissed me off no end, she was one of those "I'm so much better than you" types.

The assault came on the day President Hamid Karzai’s truncated cabinet – what was left after the Afghan Parliament twice rejected a large number of presidential nominees – was to be sworn in. It also comes prior to the arrival of tens of thousands of American and allied troops in Afghanistan.
Daniel (insert current Chinese name for his middle name) M. We hope he likes the name as much as we do. I've been floored by the number of friends who told me when I shared what we thought his name would be that have replied, 'I was going to suggest Daniel.' From what we read of his personality it sounds like he'll be agreeable.
And so I must applaud Alma Katsu on a novel so intricate that I find myself once more (for the first time since the days of early Anne Rice vampire chronicles) captivated and romanced by a fictional man that, for the most part, is little more than a villain parading himself about in a terribly unconvincing sheep costume.
I love Easter Sunday Morning's, it is a great time to celebrate the death and resurrection of our Savior. A time to renew our commitment to follow Jesus, to be changed into His image, to die to ourselves and to live for HIM.

Recently I have had several discussions with people who should really know better, people who call themselves Marxists but have advocated a vote for the Labour Party in the forthcoming General Election. A position which I cannot understand for any socialist to hold, to advocate a vote for the neo-liberal agenda of New Labour, a party which has lost all the democratic structures which means there is no hope of reclaiming the party. Nevertheless these points seem to have fallen on deaf ears amongst many so I thought I would blog from a different angle.

So on the one hand I am a Zionist, and on the other a religious Jew. The two of those don’t necessarily have to be opposed, but they are differing approaches to how I view myself, my people, the existence of a ‘Jewish’ state, and our relation and responsibilities to God.
Talking nerdy to you.
Since all writers exist in the present, all writing is unavoidably presentist. I would say that it is natural to use your current-day intellectual framework even when you write about the past. It would be dishonest not to. And it can be fun to enliven a historical text with sidelong glances at the modern. But I also believe the rules are different for fiction, nonfiction and memoir. At times I

Scott meets a young woman and falls in love and begins to question his motivations. He convinces himself to hit one more house for a big score and breaks into the home of Eugene Miller, the Mayor of Orlando. He learns Miller is the leader of a vicious supremacist group bent on overthrowing the U.S. government in a violent uprising, but is discouraged from going to the authorities when he ascertains a few members are local police officers. Scott decides he is the only person that can sabotage their plans and sets out to stop them while simultaneously struggling to elude Stone. Miller discovers Scott’s identity and goes after him with extreme prejudice, leading to a thrilling showdown between all three men.

Eventually there will be dance performances for mysterious (apparently mostly male) audiences, travels through tunnels, and a train ride. At its most basic level, the film is about cycles of life and learning, growth and maturity, innocence and experience -- the sharp desires both for knowledge and freedom and for a return to blissful ignorance.
The line-up:
Whenever I have a realistic object I need to draw I do extensive research. Running internet image searches makes this part so much easier than it used to be, when I would spend hours in the Library pouring through reference books. I looked at both photos of real Koi fish and traditional illustrations to see how they were depicted. This gives me a good style to base my final illustrations on.
The exhaust system routes the four pipes into a collector which then continues to point forwards and direct the secondary pipe low underneath the radiator to the front of the sidepods. As the exhaust routes gasses at up to 1000-degrees C, it needs insulating to protect the other equipment housed in the sidepods. Renault appear to have fitted an insulated jacket around the main length of pipe in the sidepods. What is clear from the set up is that Renault had to raise the radiators to allow the pipe to ass underneath. The R31 has unusually large sidepod inlets and this might to cope with the ducting of the cooling airflow to the laid down radiator.

Heimat was broadcast on German television, but was mercilessly butchered, to the understandable horror and anger of the director. Heimat 1 was shown twice on US television: once on cable in 1985, and again in the Fall of 1987 by PBS. The film received a very limited theatrical release here prior to being televised, but received unfavorable reviews by J. Hoberman of The Village Voice, and by Timothy Garton Ash of The New York Review of Books, who charged Reitz with sidestepping the issues of guilt and responsibility for the Holocaust. Fortunately, Reitz did not give up the distribution rights, and viewers may enjoy the work as it was intended to be seen on DVD. A word of caution however– the R1 transfer by Facets video has been horribly botched up: the image is soft; colors are faded; and the non-removable subtitles are surrounded by black rectangles, making the American release one to avoid. Thankfully, Tartan has done an exceptional job on the PAL R2 UK release, and the first two titles in the series are now available at a 48% discount, a significant savings.
The initial mishandling of the case by the Sanford Police Department is a poison pill. I don't see any way to recover from that in a criminal trial. Secondly, there is no way that George Zimmerman, with the facts being what they are today, will be convicted for 2nd degree murder. I recognized that from the start, and I was surprised by the higher charges. The jury will likely have an option to go for manslaughter, but a conviction even on manslaughter is a 50/50 toss-up, due to the tainting of the case and the media circus. I hope the Martin's can get some resolution and some peace...but I think justice may have to come by way of civil court. Criminal charges are being brought now as a way to diffuse tensions (people remember L.A. in the early 90's... I recall it like it was yesterday). I think prosecutors and the State of Florida in general would like to pass this off to the court system... hoping that the courts can fix the mess of a lunatic with an arrest record being issued a CCW license, and a police department botching an investigation. They at least would like to be able to say they sent the case to a jury. But in the end I just don't see a conviction.
And there’s a lot to be said about the current attitude the club is radiating. So far they’ve had the benefit of having a team ahead of us to chase down. But now they’re ahead in the race for third and all alone. They need to maintain this intensity, be ready to overcome the bad luck, injustice and doubts that could lie in wait over the next nine matches.

But that shouldn't be such a big deal for anyone, because in most real-life situations, it is all right if you don't know all the answers, or even any of the answers. I would even say that you can hope for better results if you can quickly admit that you do not know the answer to a specific question, or the best solution to a problem. Because the best things to know are when you need help and where to go for help. And then you go there. And you ask for help. You are not alone and you don't have to figure things out on your own. Unless you are in school taking a test. Then you're on your own, sorry. You shouldn't even be reading this.

But perfection doesn’t happen every time. Sometimes there’s something missing and you don’t know what it is. Sometimes it takes two or three (or five) times until you get it right. And if everything I made was a godsend to the tongue, I think I’d get rather bored.

Don't get me wrong... I've always loved Christmas. It really is my favorite time of the year. But, I've been increasingly convicted over the last few years that our Christmas needs to be more about the baby in the manger and less about the baubles that our North American Christmas has become. We've made a few changes-some additions and subtractions over the last few years, but there are so many traditions related to our location and our relationships that I haven't really thought about, I've simply done them. I'm planning to put some real energy into re-thinking our "normal" before next year. I'm sure lots of the old favorites will stick, but there is definitely some revision to be made.

That night I started crying again when DH and I laid down in bed and held each other. Face to face. Without a big belly between us. I just started bawling and told him how it was weird, but I was really missing being pregnant. I was sad that he missed 7 weeks of it. I was sad that we didn't get to take any maternity pics of us together. I was even sad about one cute little maternity dress with the tag still on it that I never got to wear. "It's like the wedding blues, only 10 times more," I said. He said he understands. And then said that he's having the "shooting blues." He gets a little sad that he's finished filming his movie... Um....ok, not exactly the same thing but at least he is trying to be comforting and at least he makes me laugh.

If your friend is placed into immigration custody, before the actual deportation/removal proceedings start, she will likely be transferred to an immigration detention center. If you are trying to locate her, you can use a detainee locator tool on the ICE website (https://locator.ice.gov/odls/homePage.do). If your friend was officially booked, this tool will allow you to find out where she is being held. You can also call your local Immigration and Customs Enforcement office.
Lampwork has its own special beauty in the bead world, as each bead is its own work of art. My friend Carolyn is a lampworker who has tons of smaller beads, so we thought it would be fun to design a piece of jewelry that could use a bunch of 'loosies'. These are beads without partners or sets, that have a beauty all their own, but don't always find a place in beadweaving. I have a good selection of different sizes, bought mostly because I couldn't resist their beauty, but couldn't figure out what to do with them. This necklace actually uses about four different lampworkers' beads. Carolyn's appear in the strands, and I wish I could remember who created the larger beads.

The next stop on my SB trip was the aptly named Santa Barbara Winery (http://www.sbwinery.com/). The tasting was only $10, and you were gifted the glass upon completion (old school and an awesome memento). I was partial to their reds, but that’s how I swing normally. It’s convenient to restaurants and sites, and an easy place to enjoy quite a variety of wines. Did I mention all the available free parking? I know that seems like an odd selling point to many, but if you are from Los Angeles, you know how key free and easy parking is.

My wall was covered in them, particularly the ultra-common number 18. It felt like the rarity of each sticker came in waves. One month, number 20 would be all over your wall, and number 24 would be gold. The next, number 5 would be hated for being everywhere and number 29 would be hated for being nowhere. It was dynamic, and at 10c a pop, maddeningly addictive. Never did we stop to realise that something had gone fundamentally wrong – the stickers had overtaken the gum.
Moving parallel to the poker game plot is Bond’s developing relationship with Vesper, an agent from the Treasury who’s been assigned to the mission. She’s authorized $10 million to go into Bond’s account for the poker game buy-in and she can authorize $5 million more if she deems it a wise investment. Craig and Eva Green have fantastic chemistry. The dinner scene aboard a high-speed luxury train is one of the best back-and-forths in the franchise. There’s a mutual attraction between them but Lynd makes a point to tell Bond that this will be a business trip. After they pop-psychoanalyze each other, Lynd asks him, “How was your lamb?”
Upon receiving the parcel (I'm not really sure which day it came in as I was out of the country for work), I already couldn't keep my hands away from the body frosting as well as the really lovely scented hand sanitizer.

There’s no attitude switch for the Generation Y-ers when they enter social media. The attitude of give me, credit me, and make me feel special persists everyday on social media. It doesn’t take long to see someone on Twitter complaining about what they should have gotten. Just show up late to a party advertising free food and free drink. You’ll hear the Generation Y-ers complaining about how they didn’t get any free food or free drink that they deserved. Some businesses have reported hearing the “I’m a Yelper so you should give me free food/drink.” Sadly, that’s not unheard of from unscrupulous bloggers as well.

This thriller isn't always thrilling, but it's not bad either. Pamela Franklin is beautiful and natural as Jane, while Michele Dotrice as Cathy is not quite as beautiful or talented, but she shows a little bit more skin to make up for it. Sandoe Eles, who plays Paul, seems like a real cool character, smooth and shadowy at the same time. All of the locals are a little off-kilter, and you get the sense that all of them are hiding something, and any one of them could be behind Carol's disappearance.
From the part of the mechanical time we are thinking about the design of the probes. Firstly about how to make the ribs more durable by co-curing the ribs when we are manufacturing then or adding then lately in the process by curing with the same epoxy. Secondly we are trying to figure out why our hemispheres do not keep the shape and hot discussions have been held about this topic but not clear solution has come to this problem so far. Therefore we are trying to design the lay up in a way that force the hemisphere to keep it shape by co-curing a inner ring to the hemisphere. As you can see co-curing is an option that is coming to us so here you are an illustration of what is it. It is basically to cure two components made composite by curing then together so they get a perfect fit.

I wanted to make a muffin that would be healthy, delicious and appropriate for any time- breakfast, snack or dessert. I feel that orange is a very versatile flavor. You can associate oranges with breakfast in your orange juice, it can be a snack as a fruit, or it can be in a dessert like Blood Orange Souffle.
We dug, and we dug, and we dug! After what seemed like a week, we had excavated maybe one fourth of this massive root! The flock literally tried everything we knew to kill off this plant. As a last resort, we snuck into the Garden Center and made off with a bottle of something that is designed to kill stumps! Mel borrowed a large drill from the shop guys here at Hillermann’s and we drilled many holes in the gigantic root! Into these holes we poured this stump killing formula and then we waited. It took weeks, but at long last, the leaves keeled over and the massive horseradish was pronounced eradicated!
The museum is a National Historic site and listed as the oldest House of Industry in Canada. They have some permanent displays as well as new and different exhibits. The museum was built in 1877 and provided shelter for the poor, the aged, and the homeless for almost a century. I could just feel the history oozing out of every nook and cranny in that place. It was kinda eerie!

Here I am rambling again, but that happens when I get anxious. I don’t know how many of you all use Wells Fargo, but I got some frightening news today about the checking accounts’ new fees. Allegedly, if you do not maintain a $1500 balance or at least $500 in direct deposit every month, your account will be charged a seven dollar fee. I am a student going to grad school. I am not going to have a high paying job yet (even though that sounds delightful). I can’t afford this crap.

Blair said weighing whether to target a US national required determining “whether that American is involved in a group that is trying to attack us, whether that American is a threat to other Americans.”

There are also pages on Facebook and other social networking sites set up by 'fans' of 'eyeballing', in which people seem to revel in the dramatic inebriation which seems to follow this dangerous practice.
The authorial image of the webpage is the conveying the importance of the arts (music, art, fashion), sports, and politics to the urban culture and community. I based this analysis on the fact that although the authors and editors of this webpage (magazine) could contain information on only one of the content areas displayed on the webpage, they chose to combine the content into one; keeping those interested or intertwined in urban culture in mind. The values of the readers depend on how involved they are in the content that they are

Obama has recently promised 10 billion of our tax dollars to Brazil, in order to give them a leg-up in expanding their offshore oil fields. Obama’s largesse towards Brazil came shortly after his political financial backer, George Soros, invested heavily in Brazilian oil (Pet rob ras).
I made this tag by following page 35 - Water Stamping - love this technique! The background was made with Evergreen bough, Bundled Sage, Spun Sugar Worn Lipstick, Dusty Concord and Milled Lavender Distress Inks, the ribbon was also coloured with Evergreen Bough - wont tell you what the fingers looked like! Stamps are all TH and the butterflies were covered with Frosted Lace Stickles.
I used all MME "Lost & Found" papers that I cut out and around some of the glittered borders from them, and made a frame with it. I put some thin foam under it to pop it up off the paper so it looks like a "stage". I loved the look and enjoyed working with glitter so much that I used some RAK glitter on Millie's bow on her tail and her pretty ballet shoes. I Love, Love those cute details!
Personal highlights from the judgment include:
This is probably because while writing has always come easily to me, things like drawing, painting and sewing have not. Have I tried very hard to apply myself in these departments? No. Would I like to try harder? Yes. So I’m making a start with baby steps via some messy projects with LLC.

Basran shows that this betrayal is experienced in every relationship in a young woman’s life. The mothers “Bollywood-ing” up their daughters to impress the mothers of bachelor sons, the aunts spying on the girls and gossiping about their behaviour creating ghastly rumours, the young married women insulted by young unmarried women because it is not fair that they have not followed suit, a mother negotiating the return of her daughter to her extremely abusive husband, a mother beating her daughter because she was sexually harrassed by a carful of young men because she must have instigated it…the betrayal is endless.
This holiday season, be thankful for every healthy day you have and don't ever, ever take that health for granted.
Huh? But I know: know now what makes me happy and compared to what went before, this is technicolour, that was black and white. This is living: that wasn’t.
It isn’t as conscious as that, but I’m yeah there’s some influence drawn from that tradition, simply because we’ve come from a background of listening to a lot of those bands.
Also last night, I did another long-ish yoga segment, which basically stretched out every ligament that running threw out of whack.

I guess I should back up: in order to bring Milo to Paris, I had to have a microchip implanted under his skin and he had to get a couple vaccinations. That was right before the holidays. Then I had to go back to the vet right before departing to get a Certificate of Good Health, which basically says he’s healthy, not carrying any parasites, and not being used as a mini drug mule. Then that certificate has to be stamped by the USDA. It’s quite the process. Or at least it seems so when every visit entails carting an unhappy cat and paying a lot of cash.

Toys ‘R’ Us employees do not actually set up the displays; they leave this up to the vendor, but they should be aware of the merchandise being sold in their stores nonetheless. These comic books are sold at the front checkout counters so they are highly visible to employees, managers, customers and children. Unfortunately, children are now being exposed to same-sex marriage in a toy store. This is the last place a parent would expect to be confronted with questions from their children on topics that are too complicated for them to understand. Issues of this nature are being introduced too early and too soon, which is becoming extremely common and unnecessary.

Since 1997 the changes affecting Britain as a direct consequence of the imposition of the doctrine of multiculturalism have been deep and far-reaching. They have changed this country overwhelmingly for the worse. The Conservative Party has done nothing to stop this Soviet-style agenda from being imposed. When, in the aftermath of the publication of the Macpherson Report (1999), the police were targeted and accused of being institutionally racist, William Hague, whose favourite pose is that of a straight talker, accepted the report’s findings in full. Later, during the 2001 general election campaign, when the outgoing Conservative Member of Parliament for East Yorkshire, John Townend, highlighted his constituents’ justified fears over mass immigration, Hague denounced him.
Yesterday, we were driving and hiking through the Joshua Tree National Forest, which has the most amazing landscapes. Big boulders strewn around, desert forests of gorgeous and unusual cacti like the Joshua tree, high promontories, sweeping valleys, beautiful light; it is really very unique. Leah described it as “a cross between being caught in a Dr. Seuss book and being on Mars”.

At this point, it's a cautionary tale about a boy growing up in the streets of Chicago. The mean streets like Cabrini Greens or wherever the gangs are, these days. But he's not black. I have a hard time drawing blacks, frankly, they come out as blobs but that's not racist, it's just true. Whites I can draw because they have firm outlines and pale white skin between the black of the lines on their faces and clothes. Plus when I run for office I want to use this site as a testament to my tolerance which is profound and evident.

We're contemplating taking a free table from our neighbour (hence the over-sized table on the deck) but looking at it in the diagram it may not be meant to be... unless we convert our whole yard into a deck... This is also based on estimated measurements of our yard. Depending on the actual length we may need to lose a boxwood or 2 (or shorten the deck).

Finding the unforeseen ideal object requires openness, and a quality of presence that is refreshing. When we pay attention, who knows what we will find in life, or what will find us, at any moment? I actually consider consumer browsing a meditation of sorts, and why not? The Shopping Goddess is real, and loves to smile grandly upon her devotees!
In Mein Kampf, Hitler expressed great admiration for Mussolini and did in the early days regard Mussolini as his teacher so at least part of Hitler's National Socialism is traceable to Mussolini's innovations. As noted, however, Mussolini did NOT reciprocate Hitler's regard and correctly divined and loathed Hitler's murderous personality from the beginning (Andriola, 1997). Hitler's mania about the Jews was also one reason why Mussolini derided Nazism as a doctrine of barbarians. Few modern-day Leftists would argue with that judgement.
5- Avielle Of Rhia by Dia Calhoun. I wasn’t the biggest fan of the book, but like Wildwood Dancing, the setting and costumes would make it worth it. I think the movie adaptation would be really interesting, especially with the Bretheren Of The Black Cloaks hanging around. Oh, and Avielle hiding after her home is attacked would make for an interesting movie. Come to think of it, it does have the possibility to be a better movie.

Rattan is ideal for outdoor use, because it is lightweight and easy to clean. Just wipe it down with a cloth dipped in warm-soapy water. However, synthetic rattan should be considered, if the furniture will be out in the rain. Rain will ruin natural rattan.
The night before the big game, we got a chance to go to dinner with Cassie (Hi Sugarplum) and her husband, who is absolutely hilarious! I was so relieved that our husbands got along so well and were able to hold their own conversation so Cass and I could chat uninterrupted for awhile:)

Please don’t make a comment after you have read this and tell me this disease was invented by the Apartheid rulers to wipe us out. I’m not even going to discuss that old stale story! And speaking about Apartheid, get over it. It has no relevance in 2011. Dead, gone, born 31-05-1961 and was executed on 27-04-1994. Our ultimate justification for everything that we do wrong can’t come back so we can stone it.
I learned rather quickly that I was not the best person for the job. Unfortunately, I wasn’t ever really seen as an authority figure in the theatre department. As such, everything was more difficult for me to accomplish when dealing with the cast. (For those of you that don’t know, as stage manager, some of my duties included collecting production fees, making announcements to the cast, gathering bios for the program, and relaying information between the director, choreographer, and music director.)

I was attempting to share some pictures of the bbq with you and it was just infuriating. Trying to design a decent looking layout for the post brought back the headache I got rid of this morning. After a few tries at figuring out the method to their new madness, I gave up. I knew that it was time to move to the next spot.
He blows kisses and gives high fives as often as you ask. He knows the signs for cookie, please, more but most of the time he needs a little prompting. My favorite words he says are hug and kiss, because then he gives hugs and kisses. In the few days since he had his ear tubes put in he has been babbling a lot more and saying a few more words (more, dada). I don't think it will be long before he's talking up a storm (or at least that's my hope)
it anyway, get it now.
Who knew? I had always wondered about my sour cream buying habits, but never truly faced the facts.

Part of the reason I am writing about a few Bolo flicks is to honestly just see more of his catalog. I'm not sure I've ever been a fan of an actor when I've seen as little as I actually have. The other reason is I just finally needed to break my streak and start writing shit again, and what better way to do so than with the Beast from the East... MISTER Tough Tits himself????
A while back (In the Middle of May) C took J boy to the Father/Son Camp out for our Ward(Church). It was just an over nighter. This was his second year taking his only son to the camp out and as far as I know they had a blast, especially J boy, what boy doesn't love to get dirty and sleep on the hard ground in a tent?
A great trick I’ve been implementing are workout finishers. Basically it does what you think, finishes off your workout with a bang! At the end of your resistance training session, add on one of these finishers to maximize your post workout afterburn, boost your metabolism and continue burning calories for the next 24-48 hours. The series of moves gets your heart pumping and can last anywhere from 2-10 minutes total. One of the huge benefits – you don’t need any machines. So you don’t even need to be at the gym.
A lifelong prude who thought the word bloody was the nadir of bad language and had no idea her own brother was gay, despite holidays in Morocco, a house in Brighton that he shared with a long-standing partner and a prediliction for Ethel Merman. When she watched the Naked Civil Servant with my other grandma while they were on babysitting duty at ours one time, she had to have the whole concept of homosexuality expalined to her. She simply had no idea such a thing existed. She was that naive, and easily shockable.
When J and I were first together, we were having an idyllic Sunday morning, reading the Sunday paper in bed. Filled with the perfection of the moment and the blindness of new love, he looked over at me and said "I love you, baby." But what I heard was, "I love you, bagel." This reminded me of Steve Carrel's character Brick from Anchorman:
So cheers to you, May 1st. I think you're just what I needed.

The cool thing is that the team at SuperBot was hand-picked by Sony. Each team member at SuperBot has talent taken all over the place such as guys that worked on games like UFC Undisputed, Mortal Kombat, and many other fighting games. You can kind of say that they’ve been purposely built to deliver a solid fighting game experience.
Last week I found the quilt and decided to launch a rescue mission. First step was to remove the cat hair, damp rubber gloves worked wonders for rubbing it off, then I took the binding off, and undid all the quilting (luckily it was only stitched in the ditch around each large block).
Second, I’ve created a starker and cleaner contrast of colors. The black bar rests below a defined white space and sits just above a cool red. In this way, the viewer’s eye is drawn down, towards the title of the work that rests in the bottom 1/3 of the cover. No longer are sage greens and browns competing with yellow and silver text; rather, the color palate is simplified and made starker. The eye knows where it is to go, now: to the book’s title and the author’s name. Finally, I’ve added a subtitle to the text: “a novel of instruction.”
Tons of open games waited on the site’s homepage, but Calli wasn’t into it anymore. Somewhere out there was a brown-haired guitar player who, in ninety minutes and total anonymity, had made her heart race. Travis might be that ordinary-looking guy nobody gives a second glance. He might be the ugly guy everybody stares at because they can’t look away. Whatever his appearance, she was into him. Totally, anonymously, into him.

Then we all went to dinner at Macaroni Grill, along with some of the library staff, Andrea from Mrs. Nelson's Toy & Book Shop (who sold our books at the event), and a spattering of family members. (Is that an appropriate use of spattering? If not, I apologize to any family members wrongfully spattered.)

There are many misconceptions about design. Magazines often use the word design when they mean style or fashion. For example, when they show a toaster or bottle opener which is well designed, the result is that people think that design is all about how things look. Design is also about how things work. In reality, the way how a product looks is something that (usually) happens at the end of development process.
I had the pleasure of enjoying the rest of the snackies:) I LOVED THE MOJO bar…it wasn’t packed with sugar so it was a perfect snack for me–NO CRASH! WOO HOO. The Luna bar is an old favorite of mine…I had this for emergency breakfast last week.
Bottom line: Its only flaw is leaving you wanting more of the same. Leviathan is a magnificent adventure set in a brilliantly executed steampunk World War I, with a dashing good male lead and the best underage and undercover lady soldier I’ve ever encountered in fiction.

I started feeling a lot better. I reduced it even further. I immediately noticed that my skin was better, my stomach felt better, I was less bloated, I didn't spend hours in the bathroom every morning. Within a month my depression had lifted. Within two months, my lady-cycle was regular.

ME - You might want to see what the brewery rep has to say about it.
There are so many pragmatic and logical campaigns out there these days, so we wanted to make A Taste Of The Extraordinary a little more esoteric, explain a little less and intrigue a little more. Inspired by the vast history of surreal art, photography and film, we set out to create images that reflect Drambuie's taste.
Others, like Shmuel Rosner at the Jerusalem Post, have taken a different approach, bringing up the Jenin "massacre" reports to tarnish all and any critic of Israel, as though the fact that a lie was disseminated (possibly by the IDF in the first place) in 2002 could offset the satellite images showing an attack that took place outside the territorial waters of Israel. This is part of a troubling trend of Zios copycating Holocaust denial techniques (a single Holocaust lie, like that the Nazis made soap from Jews, proves that the Holocaust itself is a lie; a single bogus Holocaust survivor, like Binyamin Wilkomirski, proves that all survivors are impostors).
Winter is a fantastic time for learning! There are just so many changes taking place in nature every day. For us New Englanders, we are approaching our 2nd Blizzard this year! This is the perfect time to talk about the words “Cold”, “Snow” and “Weather”.

Her Grandmother provided a toy that had a more long lasting impact when she traded a milk cow for a neighbour's piano. Bobbie taught herself to play by listening in church, and precociously had her first song in the bag by the time she was seven: My Dog Sergeant Is A Good Dog was later wheeled out as part of her nightclub act and survives on a BBC TV show. The rest of her oeuvre would be hugely influenced by her dirt poor, woodland community upbringing.

Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone; And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith: That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto. For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know. For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.

The most extraordinary (and counterintuitive) critique came from Poynter’s Kelly McBride—who faulted the Times, which had bent over backwards to frame the case against Witt as negatively as possible, for not doing enough to ensure that Witt’s accuser’s story was represented. To bolster her line of argument, McBride turned to adjunct law professor Wendy Murphy, who had distinguished herself in the lacrosse case for her willingness to fabricate, fabricate again, and fabricate some more.
In general, I am not a huge fan of love triangles, but this one did not bother me really. Cassia is not choosing between Xander and Ky. She is choosing between what the Society says is good for her and what she wants for herself. Cassia never would have chosen Xander, but for the Society telling her to. She loves Xander as a friend and doesn’t seem all that eager to have to change this attitude to a more romantic one, once she discovers she has feelings for Ky. So really, I didn’t think this was much of a love triangle. Cassia worries about hurting Xander’s feelings, but she doesn’t really angst on about her feelings for him (or if she did I tuned it out).

I am still fairly new to the world of blogging. I have followed a hand full of blogs for some 3 years or so, but not ventured into uncharted waters, which is why I think I’m new at it. I am trying to branch out and read more blogs. This is one of the blogs I’ve followed for the past 3 years. I don’t read it faithfully everyday, or even try to keep up with every single thing he writes, but I have yet to go to this blog and not be fascinated. The way the author has it set up you can see titles and photos from older posts along the margin and clicking those links can take you on a magical mystery tour of music and cultures you never dreamed of.

I think since I started training, studying, weight loss and exercise its been really interesting to try and observe myself from the outside and to attempt to understand why I do the things I do, my motivation and what causes me to swerve off track – I figure that if I can at least understand a fraction of it, it will help me to understand my clients and to be a better trainer.

If you know me you are laughing your head off right about now because you know how totally true this is. My house is a mess, I rarely take care of my appearance, I occasionally swear in front of my children and have been known to yell. These are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to my list of flaws and I am ok with it. Yes I can be judgemental, but if you say you're not then you are lying. I screw up sometimes and burn an entire cookie sheet full of roasted chickpeas or forget what you told me five minutes ago, but I can deal with that.
This list is not complete, but it’s a good start. And yes, many of us have help from dads, family members, and friends. But for most of us, most of the time, moms are the alpha and the omega of anything that might affect our children.

Did your parents show you that men and women have positive roles in each other’s lives? Did they respect each other? Did they teach you that you could feel secure and happy? That you could do what you wanted to do and achieve what you wanted to achieve because nothing stood in your way? How did they show you love? Was it giving or controlling? How much control did you have over any of this?
AH:I would say that I'm quiet like Solange but snarky like Lucy.
Or, take a film in which there are even three takes on an event. Kurosawa’s Rashomon (1950) presents us with three takes on the same incompossible set of events. Unlike Persona, we cannot simply see the film as two views of the same events, for these events cannot exist in the same world together. For Deleuze, a film like this is one of the earliest examples in film of what he calls the powers of the false. And beyond this, we can even imagine a film which is little more than a series of modifications of the same event (ie: the interruption of dinner, in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeosie, 1972), such as we see in many of Bunuels later films.
I had a prize for the girl that came dressed in the most "P" items. I didn't know if the girls would really get in to that. But I LOVED when the girls showed up and were wearing so many layers they looked like the little boy in the movie Christmas Story. It was hilarious. There was everything from pink hair, to puffy parkas.

You have to cook them. Because of the moths, ants and mould, there is a lot of halving, coring, trimming, quartering and peeling. You then stew them or bake them. As mine are never whole, pristine fruit like the ones in the photo, nabbed via Google, stewing is the go.
Either of the three proposals would be superior to our existing system of unemployment insurance. Critically, by establishing a separate and dedicated tax and reserve fund for job insurance, the Federal government could create a permanent fiscal structure for a jobs program, which would form the nucleus of a Federal commitment to full employment for all.

Since I’d been tested and had a rabid reading habit of my own that allowed me to devour books in a very short time, I was very advanced for being only 5 years old. The school even said that if I’d had a better grasp of mathematics that they would have considered having me skip Kindergarten and perhaps even 1st grade because I was already reading on a 3rd grade level. But, my poor math skills kept me back and I hated the first day of Kindergarten because it was nothing but recess all day. I was there to learn, by god, and all the playing was SO boring! And I couldn’t get over the other classmates who would cry and whine and need to be restrained as their parents left each day! Didn’t they realize that this was where you could learn more and be away from your parents and be who you wanted to be?
Well, take my word for it. I have learned a bunch of stuff. And I fully expect to continue being educated the hard way on plenty more things by the time I get to toast the full century mark. Here are seven things I have learned so far (and no, that is not the sum total):

And, if you were paying attention to the Collect, and how it relates to the Epistle, you will see that bishops, priests and deacons are placed in His Church to be stewards of the mysteries of Christ, in order to teach His people this very thing: To be ready to meet Him. The picture of John the Baptist is used by the Church to remind the messengers that we too must prepare the people for the coming of the Lord, for the day when He shall appear in glory, and we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.

This morning, to sop up everyone’s alcohol-filled bellies, Lionel brought in bags of croissants, pain au chocolat and pain au raisin (which is quickly becoming one of my favorites… when you get a warm pain au raisin, as this morning’s was, there’s nothing much better). Everyone is rolling in late and giggling about the night.

How bad is it? How bad will it get? Yes there is a recession in the USA and elsewhere, which is going to require careful (and lucky) management to prevent it developing into something worse. But in Ireland the perception – at least as important as the reality – is that ours is worse. For if the USA has caught a cold, Ireland has caught pneumonia. A joke circulating in Dublin – indignantly rejected by the Government – is that the only differences between Ireland and Iceland (in the grip of an economic meltdown) are one letter and six months. The talk now is not of the recession of the 1980s but of the calamitous 1950s, when hope appeared to disappear and when many families, including my own, left the country.
Hope everyone has a fantastic weekend. We are expecting a huge warm up here in PA, so me thinks there may be some outdoor time in my near future!

And thanks to the hit 1999 movie Jantar Mantar, a generation of young people think that a gang of power hungry politicians, led by Jawaharlal Nehru, brilliantly if inaccurately played by Rashed Suhrawardy, killed a saintly president. While this is pure conspiracy nonsense, one can see why it was such a hit –– Nehru the younger was obviously the biggest beneficiary of the changed political circumstances.

Carotenoids are present in the chloroplasts along with chlorophyll and produce the yellow, orange, brown colors in fruits and flowers like bananas, daffodils, corn, and carrots. These colors can be readily seen in fruits and flowers because they are part of the reproductive system and not the vegetative system, and don't produce chlorophyll in their cells.
Thanks to SBC we now how have some pics of P&O's 'smoking area'. Compare it with the above facilities provided by Holland America Line. Take into account that the pics of P&O's 'smoking area' were taken on the Channel and not the somewhat more rough and inclement North Sea. Also it was the middle of a nice day in summer and in calm seas.

Why is it that no matter what you try to do, whether it be raise your kids as you see fit, live a life of generosity and kindness, try to get ahead in your career (or start a new one), or even travel down the path of self-reflection and improvement, there is always someone who has to voice their disapproval in an attempt to bring you down? I totally hate that – it’s one of my biggest pet-peeves!

It rained all day and we were in a state of mild trepidation because we thought that the Paramore concert would be outside and that we would be exposed to the elements. In the event the venue was an amphitheatre in the Park Sowinskiego with a tent cover so our worries were for nought.
Don’t worry it’s normal
The eulogies gave Mara no comfort. The memories did not bring her daughter back. They only spotlighted everything she had lost and served as a reminder of everything she would never have again. The kind words were salt on an open wound. The wavering voices made her ache with sadness and then it was Luke’s turn to speak.
I love music. I don't have training in music, so it's not about the chords... it's about the place the music takes me. And if a four chord song can do it, that's fine. And if you need a masters' in music theory to explain it... that's fine, too. I'm like people who drive a car, but can't explain how the engine works: I don't quite understand how, but if it gets me where I want to go, we're good. And even if engineers tell me it's built very cleverly, if it doesn't get me there in a way I like, somebody else might, I don't really care what the engine specs are.

“Did I…really kill someone?” I choked. It proved harder to say than I anticipated. Daniel looked down into his lap, and lifting his head slightly up he nodded a difficult yes. Fear struck, the only thing I did was put my hand over my mouth in disbelief. With weak knees, and a heavy pain in my chest I collapsed into the chair. There was no way this was real.

One day I had a conversation with a blogger on Twitter, which started when she complained about books calling themselves ‘YA’ when they were really ‘teen’. Lots of people joined in, as we debated the difference between US YA and UK teen novels. She said she just preferred reading about High Schools, proms, baseball and road trips – reading books set in the UK just felt all wrong. That was the day that the #UKYA hashtag was born.

These “get in the boat” moments aren’t only reserved for big ticket life events either. I recently had one myself that was job related. One of my tasks at work is to write articles for In Touch Magazine, which is both exhilarating and terrifying. Why? Well, writing is like walking a very taut high wire. One wrong word can throw off the flow of a sentence, and one unclear idea can mar the meaning of an entire piece. Writing is a lengthy process of moving words and phrases around until only the best ones remain in the perfect order. It’s very easy to miss the mark, and more often than not, it is also very lonely work.
The weight of the world leads to death, as no man on his own is able to bear it. Only Jesus, was able to take on the weight of the world for all time, as He extended His arms and allowed them to be nailed to the cross. In that moment, the time had come, where our burdens of sin and shame no longer remained before us to bear. The weight of our scorn, was eternally lifted from our shoulders, if we choose to bow before Him, granting Him access as Savior and Lord, to take away all of our trash.

Ever notice have every site you go to has some type of sign up? I have one, its to the right, it says “Follow the madness.” I recently moved it to the top of my widget list because the recent posts and comments were bumping it so far to the bottom I doubt anyone saw it. Also, I moved it in hopes that YOU would subscribe to me. In doing so, you will be informed when I post new posts and will make me feel all warm deep down inside.

Porters came to be in 1722 (or'30--sources vary) when London brewer Ralph Harwood introduced a mixture of three beers common at the time. He called the resulting brew "entire" or "entire butt" (butt being an olden days word for "barrel"). Porters from the nearby produce market are purported to have liked it, hence the name. (Jackson disputes this.) As for names, I wonder if Deschutes' decision to name their porter after Central Oregon's Black Butte wasn't a nod to Harwood's "entire butt." Someday I'll ask someone.
In order to make it ‘palatable’ to adults, it features the comic stylings of Russel Brand as the voice of EB. While I have nothing against Russel Brand, most of the time I find myself asking the question ‘when did Russel Brand become a thing?’ while the CGI bunny talks like the Artful Dodger. (I have concluded, by the way, the Russel Brand became a thing because somebody saw him walking down the road and said “Is that Captain Jack Sparrow?”, and the rest, as they say, is history.) The movie isn’t funny, mostly because it’s trying so hard to be, and because Russel Brand seems to be the only person trying to tell jokes; the movie is, for some bizarre reason, a Russel Brand vehicle. And this is presumably a long time after everybody realized he isn’t really Captain Jack Sparrow.

Bert Weedon would have a lasting impact on many British rock bands of the Sixties and Seventies, and as a result he would have an impact on rock music worldwide. One need only consider that guitarists in three of the biggest bands of all time, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Who, all learned their craft from Bert Weedon's books. In fact, it is possible that some may not have become guitarists had it not been for Mr. Weedon. In a eulogy by Neil McCormick in The Daily Telegraph entitled "Farewell Bert Weedon,the man who helped make stars of John Lennon and Paul McCartney," Eric Clapton was quoted as saying, "I wouldn’t have felt the urge to press on without the tips and encouragement Bert’s book gives you." To a large degree, then, Bert Weedon is responsible for the success of the British rock bands of the Sixties and the genres they would give rise to, everything from power pop to heavy metal. Few men could boast such an important place in rock history.
A sailor on board the USS John Paul Jones during a naval war games exercise gets a lot more than he bargained for when the Earth is invaded – by a foe lying in wait beneath the waves.

Subliminal messages work the same way. They should begin with the word YOU rather than I. So the mind is essentially taking the 'you' statement as direction from the subconscious, because it is using the language of the subconscious.
“When we are on automatic pilot, trying to get someplace else all the time without being attentive to where we already are, we can leave a wake of disaster behind us in terms of our own health and well-being, because we’re not listening to the body. We’re not paying attention to its messages; we’re not even in our bodies much of the time,” explains Kabat-Zinn. “Mindfulness—paying attention on purpose in the present moment nonjudgmentally—immediately restores us to our wholeness, to that right inward measure that’s at the root of both meditation and medicine.”

He knew that 1000 years of history can come crashing down in a moment and it did and the very center of all they held dear was torn down piece by piece.
Now, I would assume I was walking away with my backpack and four leashes with four doxies on the end of those leashes. If that was not possible....I'd then walk away with four doxies stuffed inside the backpack, their leashes and a water bowl and my phone in my pocket. I'd pack the family photos that I love in a pocket of the backpack. ( I sure hope I had a big backpack, like the ones from LL BEAN) I'd never leave my pups under any circumstances....I could make do without any of the other stuff, but those dogs depend on me and I would not let them down by walking away.

LÄPPLE: Söhngen usually never gave damning judgments on any author. He never refused a priori any contribution, from wherever it came. His method was to pick up and improve the good that could be found in any author and in every theological perspective, to weave the new things into the Tradition and then go ahead, indicating the further development that could follow. But in Söhngen Ratzinger also saw a willingness to rediscover Tradition understood as the theology of the Fathers. And a willingness to do theology by going back to the great sources: from Plato to
Subject to individual country laws, a licensee does not have sublicensing rights unless the agreement authorizes them. Should the parties agree to allow sublicensing, the main agreement should specify the rights and obligations of the licensor and licensee with respect to the sublicensee(s). it is usually obvious that granting sublicensing rights is good business for the licensor and licensee. When the benefits are unclear for the licensor, but the licensee wants sublicensing rights, the licensee should prepare and present a market plan to persuade the licensor.

Our second daughter developed a lump under her chin in the recent past. This is actually the second time in the half year. My husband and I have been busy with this issue in the past few days and it looks like we might get busier in the next few days. Our second one is doing just fine despite the growing lump. She has no idea what’s going on, which I find a blessing. My husband and I had to make some decisions. We decide to do something, then we question ourselves if we’re making the right decision or not. I feel pretty confident that everything will go well. At the same time, there are always unknowns. Parenting is not for the faint of heart.

Back when shaman were largely considered back-seat healers to the much more competitive paladins and priests, even the elitest of the elite agreed that this gimmicky fight was tailor-made for the resto shaman toolbox.

Oh, and the fact that Spirit Link Totem’s healing effect isn’t really considered healing so a carefully dropped totem can “heal” a tank with the mortality debuff.

By 1966 the Stones had mastered the recording studio and the art of making records and disc three's twenty four tracks start near the beginning of the golden era, opening with 19th Nervous Breakdown (with a different lead vocal track) and two alternate versions of Have You Seen Your Mother Baby (Standing In The Shadow), both with different lead vocals over a very different mix of the basic track, the second has a piano intro not heard on the final version. Also present are Get Yourself Together (two alternate versions, one with an added electric guitar), demos for Yesterday's Papers and Dandelion (the latter is Keith's home demo with him singing lead), alternate mixes of We Love You and 2000 Light Years From Home, the infamous Gold Painted Nails (the last time Andrew Oldham would set foot the studio with the Stones), Did Everybody Pay Their Dues? which is Street Fightin' Man with its original lyric and vocal track, many alternate mixes of Begger's Banquet era tracks, the version of Jumpin' Jack Flash from the short promo film they made to promote it (very different but every bit as great as the issued 45), along with a few tracks familiar from other bootlegs-- Family, Blood Red Wine, Highway Child, finishing up with an outtake version of Mick's first solo disc-- Memo From Turner from the film Performance (Keith refused to play on it because of Mick and Anita's sex scenes, encouraged by Donald Camell, bugged him, so Mick recruited Ry Cooder, Stevie Winwood, Al Cooper and Traffic's Jim Capaldi and had 'em sounding just like the Stones by the final take).

I was walking back from my girlfriend’s house through Park South, a notoriously run-down area of Swindon, riddled with unemployment, anti-social behaviour and crime. It’s not the area of Swindon I normally associate with a ‘passion for politics’, but as I crossed the water logged field I saw a purple and yellow glow from a window. ‘VOTE UKIP’. Wait, what? – This took me by surprise, Park South has always been a Labour stronghold, we have all seen it in the media that the ‘smaller’ parties are going to do well tomorrow, but this really hit home for me. It’s bitter-sweet.
Furthermore, Revelation 14:9-11 provides a stern warning to people who receive the Mark of the Beast. Those who receive the Mark of the Beast will be punished severely for eternity.

Why is it that 80% of the world suffers job dissatisfaction? Why is that apparently the biggest cause of death by heart attack in the US, above all else, above poor diet, above bad relationships, is job dissatisfaction?

(Actually, I think it really looks like a Hostess cupcake – without the frosting… but, maybe that’s just me.) I’ll post the recipe below.
Moreover, it hurts not only the writer, but also the critic reviewing the book or article in which it occurs, unable to determine whether the guilty party was the author or the typesetter, assuming that such a creature still exists and hasn’t been supplanted by a robot.

You may notice a new page here. I finally learned how to add a page to my blog. So, this new page, called Beth's Reader's Corner, will highlight some short fiction (the first one, a flash fiction about quilting), maybe an excerpt from Standing Stones. Yes, I'm still in the research phase on Australia, such a rich history. But each book I read, each picture I find, will take me there one day.
According to various sources a repeat of the previous show (Thursday 5 April) was screened at 15:00. Thereafter the usual Friday broadcast was televised, starting at the normal time of 18:30. The Afrikaans version of the magazine, “TV-PLUS”, covering the period 4 – 17 April 2012, is one of the many TV-guides that confirms this fact.

So it’s been a while since I wrote my last blog entry and I have a very good reason for it. The past month I’ve been moving 3,000 miles to our nation’s capital in Washington DC to start a new job working on global health policy. It is a fantastic opportunity for me to get on the ground with health and see what’s really going on it our world. So if I’m MIA for a bit it just means I’m in some really cool (and remote) place. But I’m not here today to fill you in on my really cool job, but to talk about the simplest thing you can do to improve your health: WALK!

I always feel more in control if I have my house - and my life - organized. Last week, I spent several hours purging my pantry, fridge and freezer, removing nearly all of the gluten products. I couldn't believe how many products that entailed. Any unopened gluten products went to our local food pantry whereas half-opened boxes and jars headed next-door to our neighbor's house. We've had new next-door neighbors ever since this past summer, when Ring, Pocket and Posies moved about seven minutes away. We love our new neighbors - they are a Christian family with three young children ranging from ages five to 15 months.
Possessed of a brilliant mind and a love for puzzles, Dashiell Matthews, Viscount Carrington, is a crucial member of the elite Young Corinthians spy league. Assuming the façade of an addle-brained Adonis, he hunts for a notorious London murderer known as the Bishop. When fate causes him to cross paths with Miss Elena Barnes, Dash discovers an enigma that will prove delightfully intoxicating to unravel: a voluptuous beauty as intelligent as she is fearless.
Did you originally imagine the scene to be such a crescendo of bile or did it just keep building upon itself?
I am doing well. I still haven't heard from my results yet from my monitor but hopefully this week I will. I have been feeling better but still have small episodes every now and then.

This was the sparkling resume’ that scored me a Juvenile Advocate position with the McLean County Probation Department. It’s like a Big Brother/Big Sister progam but with the oversight of a probation officer and the court. A judge orders the number of hours spent together per week. The pay was maybe $10/hour, great for 1980.

I'm a big Sarah McLachlan fan. As far as I'm concerned, what's not to like? She has the voice of an angel, she's a great songwriter and a talented musician - oh yeah, and she's also beautiful and sexy as hell. And she's from the country where I hold honourary citizenship.
On Friday I went to the National Engineering and Construction recruitment fair in Birminham to see what opportunities there might be for Queen Mary Students and Graduates. The results were surprisingly upbeat. After quite a difficult recruitment year in 2009, things are starting to look up for this sector.

The theme is "favourite holiday", and I have chosen Easter. I love Easter - we always spend it at my Mum an Dad's and there are usually lots of lambs to feed and play with, as well as the Easter Egg Hunt, a bus rally for the hubby and a bit of a rest for me LOL!!

A lot of this is generalizing what I have seen in individuals, and probably not as accurate as I would wish. I really would like to get input and write an article about women who enable and some idea of why, and how to break the pattern ... Like the Ladies of the Club that was written by a number of us sharing our experiences in order to find a pattern for the problem and for the breaking away. These women need help as well, and any little thing we can do to help is worthwhile.
Scandalous though they may have been onstage, the Hoffman Girls seemed to have no trouble finding their audience. As this image of the girls cavorting on a beach demonstrates, the spectacle of 18 lovely, talented Gertrude Hoffman Girls couldn’t help but draw a crowd wherever they went.

We managed to enjoy our families in 2009. We were able to see four of the five children in person, along with their children. We didn’t make it out to Las Vegas, but we were able to virtually visit thanks to phone calls, text messages and video calls. Our faithful Prius took us to Hendersonville every other week (sometimes more often than that) to help my folks. That involved a lot of miles, but my parents appreciate each and every trip we make.
Boil the potatoes until the are tender in salted water. Saute the onions until they are tender. Place the milk, butter and garlic in a small pot, and bring up to a simmer over low heat. Place the cooked potatoes and onions in a bowl and add the milk mixture and mash the potatoes. Add the remaining ingredients. Place in the fridge to chill while you make your pasta.

Last week, Kal Raustiala and Chris Sprigman, guest bloggers on the New York Times's Freakonomics blog, posted this interesting piece about what football (of the American variety) can teach us about the correlation between copyright protection and innovation. Though focused on copyright, their point can be made easily about any form of intellectual property protection. The question at heart is whether such IP protections are truly the catalyst for innovation.

After getting situated at our B&B, we headed out for a group dinner at “La Cave.” No English translation is needed–the restaurant is literally built INSIDE a cave! How many people can say they’ve eaten inside a gigantic piece of rock? Well, now I can…
So thank you to everyone who filled my 2010. God for giving me everything. Every last molecule of it. He continues to give give give, and I still don't know why. But I stand blessed because of Him. My husband and my family who fill all the in betweens with their love, support, honest reproach, and especially normality - because although I never knew it, I needed it.
The restaurateur meant “mousse.” That is the word for a dessert — and for the foam that people put in their hair in the 1980s.

And this is what I came up with:
But wait: actual people are "ethical" on a formal, logical sort of level (respecting others' rights through applying the logic of universality) and "ethical" on a situational, emotional sort of level (minimizing felt harm through the capacity for empathy) and they appreciate "good" people who they estimate to be salutary examples of a well-realized person (a “gentleman of Athens”). In fact real ethical people (that is, people when they're actually trying to act ethically rather than merely trying to do ethical theory) use Kantian-style "golden rule" reasoning and Millian outcomes-oriented strategies and they make Aristotelean evaluations of themselves and others all at the same time. “Ethics" turns out to be a heterogeneous concept: the intentions of rational beings, the qualitative experiences of conscious beings and the health or pathology of living beings are all different things, such that there turn out to be not so much differences of opinion among "ethical theorists" as there are changings of the subject. Confusion (and sound and fury) is generated by a presumption that ethical thinking must be one kind of thinking and so there must be one “theory” that gives an account of it. The misleading grammar in this case is the use of a singular abstract noun “ethics,” which creates the strong impression that there is only one topic when in fact there are several that come under that rubric.
Dark Goddess can easily be read as a standalone novel but I urge anyone to first read Devil's Kiss then to move on to DARK GODDESS. You certainly won't be disappointed!
Irwin, however, uses the schema of the title in his work, letting those colors exists in order in the gallery, Red, Yellow, then Blue in a group of three large panels above and matching below on the floor. Irwin’s work seems mindful, however, of human involvement in an architectural space, fully opening up inquiry of perception in a full 3D and lived in realm. You might say his homage to Newman comes post Richard Serra. I could not help but think of the works other direct precedent Serra’s Delineator 1974/75, a work which induces a dizzying effect of weight and mass on the gallery goer.

“You know, he comes from a privileged background. You did not come from a privileged background.

I moved a little, just to see what he’d do. He calmly sat down my phone back in its case and ran his finger down my nose. I opened my eyes and looked up at him, desperately wanting to ask and yet terrified of the answer. What would I do if he had been doing what I’d thought he had? Would that be break-up worthy? Would I give him a second chance? Would I ever be able to trust him again?
As with most of these recipes, it uses a few simple ingredients and comes together quickly. It would probably go even quicker if I just cut the dough into squares, but I use small bone-shaped cutters to make her treats. I also use round cutters and even have one that looks like a little cat that I have used from time to time. This time I just used the circle and the bone-shaped one.
We eat one dal (pulses) dish almost every day. Here is an earthy dal preparation using green-gram dal and brinjals. You may also choose any other vegetables that you may have handy, viz., cabbage, french beans, ridge gourd, snake gourd, potatoes, etc., with this recipe.
The coolest moment for me though was camel pose, second set. Instead of facing the front mirror she had us face the back wall to start. In the full expression, we ended up looking at our own posture in the front mirror... upside down with our smiling happy faces. It was incredible!!! Such an exhilarating moment for me. I looked at myself in the posture and just thought wow, look at my body! It's amazing! Beautiful, strong, powerful. Not the kind of thoughts I think about myself without yoga! But I gained so much respect for myself in that moment. I realized that in spite of its flaws or pain or whatever else, my body is powerful and capable and full of potential. Anyway, it was a really cool moment for me and a great

The British soldiers at least had names and faces in the British media. The 16 civilians were just a number for most people. And naturally the authorities started talking about a “lone gunman” as a way of washing their hands of the affair.

The results showed that anxiety scores were significantly lower in the hypnotherapy and relaxation groups and the levels of sedative required were also significantly lower in the hypnotherapy and relaxation groups. Furthermore, postoperative vomiting and nausea was only 1.2 per cent in the hypnotherapy group compared to 12.8 per cent in the relaxation group and 26.7 per cent in the intravenous sedation group. The hypnotherapy group also reported higher satisfaction with the anaesthetic procedure and greater surgical comfort.

On the subject of speeding: the only mail bag we get which is bigger than the one containing complaints about police speeding enforcement, is the one from people complaining that we do not take enough action over speeding! Again I ask; what will the locally elected police commissioner do about this? Which ever way they go, they will lose 50% of the votes, which is why policing should not be a matter for local voting in the first place.
I stopped on the side of White Tail, flipped on my hazard lights and got out. I went around the wooded area to try to get a photograph as they went to the cleared area. I was at the bottom of a steep hill when the first one came out of the woods at the top of the hill in front of me.
Again with this idea of athleticism… elite athletes fuel themselves well and train accordingly in order to push themselves to a physical limit and beyond. So for me this begs the question of how might I be fueling my moral and emotional strength to prepare myself for great tests. Part of that is certainly in how I take care of myself physically (healthy body, healthy mind) but also in the people I allow to be close to me and become my models. If I want to be morally and emotionally strong, then I have to surround myself with others who are also trying to “train” in the same way, or who are already strong in that way. Thankfully, I am privileged to have these relationships in my life.
Not only can you not marry just anyone, you can’t marry everyone either, though some of us have tried harder than others. Believe me, I have been incredibly open-hearted in my choices of life-mates. It’s time to get smarter. So, while it may seem cruel, if one is selecting a mate, it’s entirely understandable, even necessary to be very selective.

In the tale of Rumpelstiltskin, a mill owner boasts to the king of his daughter’s talent for spinning straw into gold. Presumably he utters this fib in a moment of reckless abandon, consumed with ambition and the desire to please. Why the king believes him is another question. Avarice and hubris rub shoulders thickly. So the mill owner’s daughter – beautiful, naturally, but quite lacking such talents, is set to work amid bales of straw. She must spin it into gold by morning, or perish at the king’s command. Men do not emerge well from this tale.
The story does not reveal if Harry and Horsie's real life home is in the city, but that information is really not very important. Although there are nods to New York City, the city in CookieBot! is pure imagination. After all, any good futuristic science fiction tale with an over sized villain takes place in the city, right? Think Godzilla! Think... okay, I can't think of any more, but my point is that in our popular imagination, giant robots do not crash through the woods or the flower garden. They terrorize innocent urban populations who run down streets flanked by skyscrapers!
It seems that more exhibitors this year are concerned about issues of sustainability, as well as presenting more sustainable seafood. This is obviously a very good thing, as protecting the bounty of the sea is a crucial issue. I feel more positive about matters when I see so many exhibitors who are similarly concerned. And if you want to learn more about sustainability, you can discuss the issues with various exhibitors as well as attend some of the sustainability seminars. It was also good to see they will have a seminar, Selling Diners on Sustainability, which will help restaurants sell more sustainable seafood.
That’s all fine! You are quite welcome to be all gushing with sentimentality- go for it- but that is not what is there for me to say right now.
With this in mind, ranchers have to weight how many cattle to hold on to when there is a lack of rain and hay along with high prices, while at the same time holding back replacement heifers to rebuild their herd. Dr. Darrel Peel, Oklahoma State Extension livestock economist has said that it will take five to six years to start rebuilding the national cowherd. This represents a great opportunity for young and up and coming ranchers to get involved in the beef industry in years to come.

I love the faux monochromatic look too. Makes a pieces dance. The few manly quilts I have designed have all been earthy on colour and prone to reflect architecture. I did do one log cabin for grandfather in reproduction fabrics.
These accounts are company confidential, and confidential for good reason. You really don’t want a competitor to know the details of your cost structure because that is a significant part of competitive advantage. Companies make attempts to benchmark themselves against competitors in order to measure competitive advantage. You might not wish a price war, as your goal isn’t to destroy the competition but to provide a return to investors, but you might wish to know whether your operation is as efficient as the competitors and whether you could win one if they picked a fight.

The first time I read it, I was unfazed. Although I don’t want to go into specifics, I will say that I currently work in higher education. For some time I’ve felt rather lucky in my belief that that area was safe from this whole economic crisis. Historically when the economy went down, people went back to school. It was a win for my profession!
It doesn’t mean that you won’t need to put the work in but that you should follow your natural writing instinct. If you have a sudden strong desire to write a story then follow it! If you have never done any writing before then you will have to try to learn to follow your writing instinct. I call it an urge or an itch. Sometimes it creeps up on you and you just have an intense urge to write something. Other times it disappears for ages and you miss it like crazy.

I'm slightly ashamed of how many blues I gathered upon a quick inspection of my polish collection. I have pales, mediums, deeps, brights, shimmers, glitters... you name it and I probably have it. For this comparison though, I stuck with the lights and dusty lights-mediums. The first three shades are not dupes at all, but they serve as a sort of comparison to the comparison, if you will. It is interesting to see how much green is in What's With the Cattitude and "Baby" Blue compared to a true light blue- Joe's Powder Blue.

I took a standard M-type for a spin with a telescopic seat post. Bad memories of previous Brompton experiences were soon erased. The Brompton, once you get it going, is an absolute blast to ride. The handling is nimble and quick, my preference for commuting as I don’t want to be caught dozing. Even with the standard bars, I found the bike offered acceptable comfort. With the extra 5-6cms of bar height, longer rides will also be an option.

You may or may not have noticed that my blog remained rather silent this week. I actually did write a post for Wednesday, but I didn’t like it and didn’t feel comfortable posting it, so I didn’t. It was actually quite liberating to make that decision and be okay with it. I considered coming up with something else, but I simply did not have the time or the motivation. It has just been one of those weeks. Hopefully all of you understand and can forgive me.

When it comes to finding out how prosperous or how well-known the item is there is certainly seriously merely one standards-how well manages to do it market? That is really the idea of your capitalistic process that we’re in. In the event the merchandise seriously isn’t well-known doesn’t necessarily market. Case the way in which our body operates. In the event the technique is excellent and it is inexpensive and there is a dependence on it-it’ll be well-known.

There are so many more moments like this, large and small, that I can’t begin to describe them all here. And the truth is, most of the best moments weren’t the big momentous events, but the average Thursday night, when we wandered down the street and slid onto a barstool, only to find Joe Costa there, or Molly and Lindsay, Amy, Kay, Joi, Tony, Albert, Martha (miss you, Sweet Lady), Sailor Bob, Old Man Bob (RIP, my friend), Judge ____, an iconic rock star, or any of a cast of regular characters that became the colorful cornerstones of a richly-lived life, complete with hosts of friends, more than a few excellent cocktails, and the telling of many, many unforgettable stories.

The loose linework, owing a greater debt to contemporary European art comics than anything published in the English language, will not be to everybody's taste, but perfectly supports the queasy tone of The House That Groaned.

Mephibosheth was of the house of Saul, the man who had tried to kill David, yet David showed him forgiveness, kindness, and treated him like a member of his own family.
Why should we confess our sin? Because God says we should.
To make them, all you have to do is take a pair of trousers/shorts that you like the fit of, I used pyjama bottoms because I didn't have any shorts and because they aren't too tight. Draw around them then cut off where you want the legs to end (if you used trousers instead of shorts). Then add a 1/4" allowance all the way round and a 1" extra on the waistband for the elastic. I used 3/4" elastic which fits nicely inside a 1" waistband but if your elastic is thinner/wider adjust the waistband accordingly.
Awe. Poor us. Poor me. Poor world. I have no clue where this bug came from. I had been taking my herbal pills, and drinking my healthy green barley juice, before I got sick.
The splintering of Rock Music into numerous sub-categories was in full force by the end of '69. While folk-rock and acid rock had "flowered" between 1965 and 1967, it was 1969 that gave us the first big hit of jazz-rock via Miles Davis, Blood, Sweat & Tears and the Chicago Transit Authority. Blues-rock was almost over, as evidenced by the deaths of Cream, Blind Faith and John Mayall breaking up his Bluesbreakers (for a jazzier sound). The Band came out from behind Dylan's shadow and brought a resurgence of "back to the earth" style traditional/acoustic music that saw everyone from Crosby Steals the Cash to Bonnie & Delaney promoting the rootsier sound of American music. It seems like the musicians at that time were tired of just playing good old pop or rock music. Experimenting with longer song structures and not even wanting a top forty hit were the new requirements for being a successful band. Disaster was coming for those who enjoyed a good tight, three-minute song with memorable hooks and a great melody. The purity of Rock music as the counterculture’s artistic expression, musicians as the "modern day painters" of the late twentieth century was changing. Moneychangers in the temple like David Geffen had corrupted everything down to simply dollars and cents. If all that weren’t enough, the cold wind of Prog arsery would soon be upon us all.

Sea lice, in particular, are a problem. In a recent L.A. Times story, Alexandra Morton, an independent biologist and critic of salmon farms, is quoted as beginning to see sea lice in 2001 when a fisherman brought her two baby pink salmon covered with them. Examining more than 700 baby pink salmon around farms, she found that 78 percent were covered with a fatal load of sea lice while juvenile salmon she netted farther from the farms were largely lice-free.

But I promised my mother I would call her before any expensive purchase (she likes to keep tabs, you see), and followed her strict advice in letting it go. It was pure lust, not love, she had me admitting. And, I didn't need a fur coat. I was too young ("It would be obnoxious") and I really didn't have any posh events to wear such a fabulous coat to... so I held off, but I'm still keeping a lookout for this future fashion investment. After all, I am getting older: 20 is a good year, isn't it?

conflict; one of the plot points is a Cain & Abel-type situation between Callie’s father, Will, and his brother. Other family members and townsfolk make themselves known, as well, and not always for the better. Every character, though, is dear to me. But at the heart of Delicate Armor is this strong bond between Callie and her father, which greatly influences her formation as she comes of age and helps to prepare her for the inevitable losses she must face.
I can feel it pulling me closer. The tidying of work is just the blade being sharpened getting me ready for the plunge into battle.

Got a 5K race coming up this weekend....hopefully will be a new personal record, not that I run a lot of races, but would love to get out of the 40's on this one. I don't THINK it will be a problem and the last mile is pretty much downhill, so hopefully will do well and not hurt myself. Got my W*I*S*H shirt in and thinking I will sport that bright green lovely along with my yellow Team Sparkle skirt. I will be easy to find - that is for sure.

Looking to see if the title of the previous had been taken, I stumbled across this poem and for a moment my breath was taken away. I know nothing of the poet, and I realize that my own translation is too literal and too close to the original--too crude. But I hope it gives a little sense of the beauty that captured me as I stumbled through my morning routine.

But I want to show some improvement in my writing, so I’ve turned to several books. If you haven’t heard of them before, you are really missing out. The reading is fascinating, but is rather overwhelming too. There is much more involved in writing a great novel than I ever realized, and while intimidating it hasn’t put me off from continuing to write. It just brought home how much I have to learn. Since I just started last semester I knew this wouldn’t be easy or quick. I’m in it for the long-haul.

It also assumes that Muslim countries would be prepared to take in hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of angry, confused, impoverished, sickly refugees. They would be acquiescing in the cessation of the flow of remittances the refugees would otherwise have sent home, and the loss of a considerable amount of political influence in Europe. It is therefore entirely possible that they would simply refuse to allow such deportations to take place, by closing their airspace and cutting all diplomatic relations with the countries in question. The attitude of the Arab world to the plight of the Palestinians, allowed to rot away in their filthy refugee camps as long as they are of some political utility there, is extremely instructive in this regard.

Here I sit, in the quiet calm of my kitchen. Lights dimmed, candle burning, wine to sip and my friend, Laptop. I have just put the boys to bed after visiting the neighborhood bonfire. The boys had a blast playing with all the neighbor kids and I got to involve myself in adult conversation and soak in the warmth of the fire combined with the chill in the air. Perfect bonfire weather, I think.

And as for the PA, they have verbally recognized Israel's right to exist, in English, but Fatah, who runs the Palestinian Authority never has. They have never renounced violence.

In ancient ruins as far apart as Egypts Great Sphinx, the strange Andean temples at Tiahuanaco and Mexicos awe-inspiring Pyramids of the Sun and Moon, he reveals not only the clear fingerprints of an unknown people who flourished during the last ice age, but also disquieting signs of high intelligence, technological sophistication and detailed scientific knowledge of the cosmos aeons before any previously known civilisation.

This is what ole Bill was talking about. If you want your message to get people's attention, you have to make it worth their while, and you have to make it fresh. This requirement for creativity makes things complicated. How does one depict the truth imaginatively, without some extent of exaggeration, or creative license? Where does one draw the line? You may think that Honda's ad is OK, because it doesn't actually claim anything about the actual product that is untrue.

"So, I sat down and read the story, to get a feel for the tone, mood, etc of the novel. I was instantly transported into the world that Lauren Baratz-Logsted created! I wanted to capture the feeling of being from the outside looking in on this classic story of LITTLE WOMEN. At first, most of my cover comps were similar to what had already been tried: they featured images of girls reading, etc. Then I thought it'd be interesting to see the main character sort of 'spying' on the characters in LITTLE WOMEN. I had a few options where a girl pulled back a curtain on a scene of LITTLE WOMEN, but they didn't have the impact I was hoping for. After looking and looking for more 'spying' images, I ended up finding the image on the final cover, the girl popping through a piece of paper. That's where everything started coming together, with the original LITTLE WOMEN artwork and the modern girl coming through the page...."

Working with Chris Miller and Phil Lord was brilliant fun. Seeing two friends also be professional collaborators on this level of film-making was really inspiring. The comedy of this movie goes beyond slapstick humour. It’s truly intelligent hilarity. It’s a challenge to write and to communicate to your team behind the cameras as well as in front of them, and they did both with chillaxed ease. Seriously. These guys are awesome.

On February 10, 2010, CME announced its purchase of 90% of the Dow Jones’s Indexes including the DJIA. Yesterday, it was reported by the Wall Street Journal to be ‘in advanced talks’ with McGraw to buy its S&P ratings subsidiary. (The former’s shareholders more or less ordered McGraw to dump S&P.) And then, just four hous ago – in what I find an astonishing development – The Journal led with insider CME knowledge that the game plan is ‘to combine stock-market icons such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 into a joint venture that would give the firms more sway over investors and exchanges around the world’.

It has occurred to me that no one in the world has more access to info.insight into human nature, more interesting stories about what we as a species really are. Things that are more interesting than outer space, inner-space. Why we do what we do, because we are a mix of hereditary/environment. What trumps, more often, how do you empower people? How do you help children whose identity has been fucked-over?
Grace Askew isn’t waiting to get old. Metaphorically, she’s wearing purple now, and Go My Way is her declaration of independence. Askew sings in a smoky torch alto, and her voice is a powerful instrument. When I reviewed her last album, I enjoyed her jazzy blues. But her new band, Black Market Goods, pushes her to new heights. I can see now how her past work was only a warm up. Here, Askew finds new strength. The band adds some twang to the mix, and it’s all to the good. Some singers can slur their words to great effect, helping them to create a certain type of character. That was Askew’s strategy before, and I enjoyed the results. But now she is singing her words clearly, possibly so that they can be made out above the band, and this frees her. Go My Way still presents a character from a lower stratum of society, but now there is a sense of the character’s personal strength that wasn’t there before. It’s going to be a joy to see how this band develops going forward.

It appears St. Patrick's Day has fallen to cultural Marxism, and that it has less to do with St. Patrick, Catholicism, Christianity, or the Irish than ever before in history. So maybe it's just as well that St. Patrick's Day parades seem to be fewer and farther between in the United States. The day will become increasingly irrelevant as Third World cultures demand to be front and center in any kind of public event, and they are happily obliged by our disloyal ''officials'' who miss no opportunity to fawn over 'diversity.'

In North Korea, really, we are talking about Igno-Think. They know only what they are told. What they have been told since they were born. Nothing exists outside the North Korean bubble.

Yes, this mother's day let's pat ourselves on the back for all of the many incredible things we do as women--and most of them one handed! But, I'd also like to take time to reflect how I can be a better mother. Don't get me wrong, I'm about to enjoy some delicious german pancakes from my husband and I will enjoy the pampering that comes today. But I don't want to sit on my laurels. I've been planning this post for awhile and figured today might be a good day to air these thoughts.

Maison Akira was good in three areas - starter, dessert and attentive service. The two outliers were decor and the entree - if you and your guest don't put so much focus on ambience as part of the overall experience, you'd be fine - but as dining is a about the holistic experience for me, Maison Akira is not at the moment a place I would personally trek out to Pasadena to make an evening of. If I happen to be in the area already, then I may stop by for a drink and foie or dessert. And as for the sea bass - there is a similar dish on the regular tasting menu for $34 - again, at that price I would rather have a nice night out at a place like Beso or Osteria Mozza. We hadn't tried any of the other three entrees on the dineLA menu, they may be perfect, but we can't speak to it, that would be something for others to take a chance on!

Preheat oven to 350. Combine flour, oats, soda, and salt. In another bowl beat butter on high until creamy then add sugar and beat until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time beating until fluffy then add vanilla and beat again. Add flour mixture a little at a time until barely blended, then stir in chips.

Not really! For me, the thing that ends up coming in last place is free time alone. Now and again, Alex will go out to meet a friend, while I'll stay home, have a glass of wine and read magazines; or I'll sneak out at night while he's home and get a pedicure, but overall free time by myself is pretty rare. That's ok for me, though. I'm kind of a pack animal anyway.
It’s now the year 2000 and there’s a new Diablo game on the shelves. The sequel sees the avatar from the original title overcome by the eternally corrupting influence of evil. You see Blizzard has cleverly wrong-footed players of the original title: using any kind of demonic magic without reading the instruction manual first is highly ill-advised. If you want to blame anyone, and I do, fault should be laid at the feet of smug old Deckard Cain, who probably saw all this coming but wanted to keep his corner of the Identify Magic Items market for himself.
In conclusion – and here I’m addressing the BWA / Brit Writers directly – your current non-disclosure of information is, in my view, causing legitimate concern amongst the community of new writers. We will always vigorously champion any organisation or initiative which helps the new writer. I hope we can champion you. But at present we need some answers. I invite you to supply them.Hopefully the BWA will respond.

It's totally common sense. When I nannied toddlers, I stood beside them or hugged them when they had a melt-down. I understood that 'tantrums' were their way of coping with pent up frustrations. I knew they needed the tantrum to release. But I had somehow managed to break that connection for babies. I just saw babies as vulnerable and totally dependent on us and therefore needed soothing always.

This weekend was Hofstra University’s yearly Relay for Life event. For those who do not know what Relay for Life is, it is a walk put on by the American Cancer Society to help raise money to find a cure for cancer. There is no specific cancer that the money for this cause goes directly towards, it is for all types of cancer; skin cancer, breast cancer and throat cancer just to name a few. During Relay, people create teams where the idea is to have at least one person walking the track at all hours. They are allowed to switch off and even have more than one person walking at a time but having a person walk the track signifies fighting and/or helping find a cure for the various cancers.

Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood.
As I wander down the path of life, instead of viewing the Golden Gates far down the road, I have the ability to experience and enjoy life while I am fit, able and full of energy, so I can look back and know I tried everything I wanted to at the time.

“We broke the Taliban’s momentum. We’ve built strong Afghan security forces. We devastated al Qaeda’s leadership, taking out over 20 of their top 30 leaders. And one year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. The goal that I set — to defeat al Qaeda, and deny it a chance to rebuild — is within reach,” Obama said. “Here, in the pre-dawn darkness of Afghanistan, we can see the light of a new day on the horizon.”
Couscous agli Agrumi - Citrus Couscous (by Alessandro Guerani) - a very strong color contrast. The yellow and purple are strong colors in contrast to the green. The large area (negative spave) the green is taking here brings the green into a good balance to the two stronger colors yellow and purple.

Washington, D.C. - An analysis of new data on jail populations in the U.S. shows that the number of people confined in local jails is declining at a more rapid rate than in state and federal prisons. The Sentencing Project finds that from 2007-2010 the incarceration rate in jails declined by more than three times the rate of prisons, 6.6% compared to 1.8%.
I readily admit I have no idea what these schools were like at this time, but this assembly and witchhunt over an article about admitting women seems melodramatic. Also, another scene that depends on a really long extension cord.
Do you have one of those digital picture frames? I love those! They look like a normal picture frame displaying some favorite photo, but then in a moment or two the photo has changed and now you're looking at a different photo. A brilliant idea! If your digital picture frame accepts USB devices, you can plug your Picture Keeper device right into it and have all the photos on Picture Keeper instantly available for viewing on the digital picture frame.

First I want to say thanks to everyone who has stuck with me in this hiatus-esque leave of mine. I wasn't gone I just...wasn't feeling the lolita blog. I'm lost when it comes to what you wanna know or read about that hasn't already been done and better and while this blog is about me as well it's also meant to be enjoyable and I'm struggling between 'whine whine baww, do this how I tell you' and 'here's a fun and different approach to try!' Obviously my opinions don't fall on the former side but I feel like I stray that way a lot. So from now on I'll be at least trying to just stick with the tokyo fashion stuff ever two weeks and then seeing how we go from there. Once again thank you so much! I'll be trying to get a better post up tomorrow but for now here's the last Tokyo Tuesday spotlight I wrote up before I left but never posted because I just wasn't sure of the content, please let me know what you think!
"The data suggests that consumers—especially those who have already adopted tablet or e-reader technologies—are forward-thinking in their expectations of these technologies and accompanying content. The problem lies with publisher expectations of what it will take to get there," Dr. Taylor noted. "Some believe a PDF copy of the print version of a publication is sufficient…consumers say it is not. Consumers expect content on all devices, all platforms, varying screen sizes, synced between devices, to be shared among friends socially, paid for in micro-payments and accessed via a mobile app. It seems that consumers will dictate the ongoing evolution of these technologies as publishers struggle to keep up with the desirability of new channels of content distribution, new expectations for content sharing, new demands for device interchangeability and new freedom to engage content – especially the written word. In an industry with 500 years of a single press-based business model, significant difficulties lie ahead."
OK, I’ve calmed down now. Luckily it’s not only passed, but I also didn’t wake up during the night with anxiety which usually happens when I have anxiety the night before. Wow, it totally knocked me out. I slept all evening and then was up until 1am, took my meds and was knocked out by 1.30am. I’m pretty sure that I didn’t wake up during the night whatsoever. If that is true, then it’s unbelievable! That hasn’t happened to me in many months. I had a really good nights sleep. Something worked.

If you are ever left with nothing, but you manage to salvage some plywood, some 2x4s, plastic sheet, duct tape, staple gun, a hammer and some nails, you can make a pretty acceptable shelter until you find something better. People in third world countries and now tent cities in first world ones do it all the time.
When I am with him I see the way that things are supposed to be. He shows concern for me, worries about me driving long distances, cares when I am sick, asks about my day, and never makes me feel less than I am. When I am with him I feel like I can do anything. I feel calm and care free…. I long for the days that I can see him and when we part I feel such sadness. Although we email every day…I maybe see him only 2 – 3 times a month.
In fact, sometimes the organs really want the baby out, but the baby flatly refuses to leave. This is when you usually end up with a Caeserean section, in which the doctor plays the role of a sheriff’s deputy with an eviction order. It’s messy and painful, just like in real life, but sometimes it has to be done. You just hope that everyone can recover and move on once it’s all over.
It never ceases to amaze me how The Fishwrap inserts itself into Pottstown’s affairs. There is a fine line between reporting the news and “creating” the news.

But, I don't want you to think that I have not spent some of this time chomping on my nails! This unschooling journey is about nothing if not trust and faith. Having been around the block a few times, now, I already knew the possible outcomes that are offered in the school setting: the boredom, the ridicule, the irrelevance, the condescension, the busy work, and, yes, the very real possibility that a kid might connect with a loving, concerned, interesting, interested adult. But that possibility notwithstanding, we opted to err on the side of dignity, wholeness, slowness, and unremitting joy. I will never regret that choice.
Libraries are very different everywhere like in Natick our libraries in the center of town but in Papua New Guinea it’s in a village called Amia. Also we can get to our library by car, walking, or biking, however people in Papua New Guinea get to their library in a four by four truck. In our library we get check out books for 3 weeks, on the other hand we don’t know how long people get to check out books in Papua New Guinea. Lastly, we have technology in our library, but in Papua New Guinea they don’t. As you can see libraries are very different.
I have actually been told, by radical feminists in grad school, that I was betraying the sisterhood by taking Odysseus's last name when we got married. I've been told that the only valid choice for me, as a woman, was going on for my PhD (which I don't want), and looking for a full time position in an English department (also don't want), and possibly going into administration (really don't want--I teach because I love teaching, not because that's the hurdle to working in Academia, and admin doesn't have time to teach), because we can't have a man telling us what to do! I had more than one radical feminist tell me that my hobbies were wrong because they were traditional women's work (wrong--knitting was a man's work while he was watching the sheep).

In the trucking industry, it is always wise to look for the money trail in any sort of proposed regulation supported by the mega carriers. In an article dated April 2012 on the ATA website it states, “After a year of quarterly increases, the turnover rate for truck drivers at large truckload fleets unexpectedly dipped one percentage point to an annualized rate of 88% American Trucking Associations Chief Economist Bob Costello…”

Late December of 2011, the Los Angeles City Attorney filed suit against AHF arguing that putting the proposed initiative on the ballot would be too costly for the City–$4.4 million. Furthermore, the City Attorney argued that the initiative would be a waste of taxpayer funds because the jurisdiction rests at the state level and that the initiative is likely unconstitutional.
“Listen,” I said to her, “my suggestion, if you want to save these shakes would be to buy another cooler now. After driving an hour, stop and get another couple of bags of ice to put in the other cooler. After another 30 minutes, stop and switch all of the shakes to the other cooler.”

A couple weeks before the recent election I had a conversation with a professor at a mainline-denominational seminary. I asked him about the political climate within the faculty at the seminary. He said it is a one-issue topic with everyone. The only thing anyone cares about is abortion. He said he’d changed his stance a few years ago. It wasn’t that he felt any differently about the issue of abortion, but he’d realized there are many other important issues, such as poverty, with which we as Christians need to concern ourselves.

I am leaving home for Hong Kong again on May 7th. Most of the food I’m planting now will not be ready till I’m gone, and then I’ll miss most of it in its height. The food in our freezers and shelves lined with goods will stay behind while I jump on that plane. I will eat at restaurants every day again, finding little caveats from those meals founded on rice and noodles. Fresh mangoes, yogurt and muesli, Chinese broccoli, salmon and shrimp…
Now, clearly, this was a breach of conduct on the coach’s part. But it certainly sounds like it was also a breach on the part of the young men who, as seniors, I can’t bring myself to call “kids.” If they are 17, they’re old enough to drive. If they are 18, they are old enough to go to war. But they’re not old enough to wait for an hour at a restaurant for their parents to come pick them up?
I am currently reading “The Art of Non-Conformity” by Chris Guillebeau, thanks to fellow blogger, Erin’s, high praise of the book. I’d been reading her blog, and her enthusiasm for the book made me seek it out. Then I discovered that the book is about being unconventional, and –being the rebel that I can be– I had to get my hands on a copy of this book. I went to my local library’s website, and found that they only had the audiobook copy… so I asked them to interlibrary loan a paperback copy for me, and they did! (go, library!) So yeah, now I am reading it, and it’s definitely good. I’m enjoying it. I especially like that there is lots about being an entrepreneur — this is something that’s had my focus, the last little bit, as I’ve always wanted to be one, myself, and lately I’ve been researching for my own future business in Graphic Design (not to mention, my new job is all about small business start-ups).
The seeds for tomorrow –
Today, I am blogging for the first time in far too long! The reasons for this are stress, lack of time, laziness and loss of camera. I've spared you many posts about ill children sitting and watching Peppa Pig for endless hours, and I've really hibernated this winter! I am emerging, though, and feeling pretty good about things. I'm writing, I'm exercising, I'm able to think about making food, cleaning up and playing with playdough without feeling like screaming. I'm sad that my sewing machine is broken but happy to be knitting something real (a hoodie for my tiny girl, can't wait to have enough of it to justify a picture!) and planning other knitted things until I can afford a new machine.
Ah. Endless dilemma. A constant circular problem.

This quote and others I have read give a good insight into the reasoning behind Nan Goldin taking self-portraits. Nan One Month after Being Battered is, of course, one of the most famous of Goldin’s photographs and has a very strong narrative behind it. In just one image with Goldin looking straight at the camera, it tells us a lot about what has happened to her, how she feels about it and how she wants to move on from it. My own self-portraits definitely do not have anything this strong behind them, though I am not sure it is always necessary. Goldin it seems though have a very busy and fast moving life, which her other photographs show from being taken in different situations and places all around the world.

You have no idea how many men I see in my business who “move on” because of sex, largely abandoning meaningful relationship with their young so as to satisfy their own desires.

Guard your heart. Your husband or wife should be the first person with whom you share your hearts desires, hurts, or secrets. A woman should never share her heart with another man and a man should not confide in a woman other than his wife. Protect your marriage relationship by giving your spouse exclusive insight into who you are as a person. Proverbs 31:11-12 says, “The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil. She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.” Do your spouse good and guard your heart only to be shared completely with them. The verse talks about the wife and how she is good to her husband, but it should work both ways in a marriage relationship.
It needs to be simple and not able to be confused with something else.

Let me first just say that these pictures are a big deal! We have been trying since September to get decent photos of the triplets and each time, something has gone wrong. Orginally, I had set up with another mother of multiples and photographer who had offered to take photographs of the kids for an outdoor shoot, but each time would be cancelled due to bad weather. By November, we were ready to try again and the kids were all sick as dogs so no such luck then either. In December, we thought we'd take them to a studio place just to get some shots for the holidays but then we had a blizzard on the day I scheduled to go and never made it back because of all the hectic holiday stuff going on.

Bear in mind that expecting the conclusion you arrive at to apply perfectly to everything all the time is like looking for a pair of shoes in a steak using a sweater. It won't. Why? Because at the same time you're engaged in this process, other people (although not nearly enough of them) are doing it too, which means that ideas and points of reference will shift. Things outside your sphere of perception and control are meanwhile continuously beginning, changing and ending. Bear in mind too that your ability to perceive is limited, and you will never achieve omnipresent omniscience, which even if you did, might not provide you with much of a 'reason' or 'meaning' anyway.

So this Saturday, as our Scout troop unbags, sorts and packs tons of food, I'll be grateful for all the support and encouragement we've been given over the years - from an NFL MVP to every generous person who steps outside on a chilly November morning to put a can of Spam in a plastic bag.

Getting to Púbol: The town of Flaça - just 2.5 miles from Púbol - is a stop on the Renfe train line that runs from Figueres to Barcelona. One must buy separate tickets for each leg of the trip. A pedestrian path from the train station to the castle is not clearly marked, though travelers certainly can make the trek on foot as roads are flat and well-paved. A short taxi ride to the castle is approximately $15.
A Defense Department spokeswoman responded in an email that it was "standard practice not to comment on Congressional correspondence; we will respond to the Congressman as appropriate."
"It was not a matter of agreeing or disagreeing with the slogan or Santa Cruz's decision," Stevens said. "We did not think it was an issue that needed to go any further, especially since it had already caused controversy."
Williams suffered a dislocated shoulder during a post-practice workout session when a group of guys -- including Jamal Crawford, Chris Johnson, Luke Babbitt and Nolan Smith -- were putting in extra work. Williams and Smith were playing one-on-one and Williams drove baseline and tried a hard dunk. Johnson elevated and blocked the dunk so hard it popped Williams' left shoulder out of socket.
Hickson played a lot of center for the Cavaliers when Shaquille O’Neal would go through long stretches of missing games with various injuries, and says he’s happy to play either inside position.
Heading into a long lull before the late-August GOP convention, the presumptive GOP nominee may find it hard to keep himself in the headlines. Obama just has to do presidential things to seize attention.
Kipling says Baltimore’s “booming life-science, international finance and maritme commerce sectors make the port city a prime place to score a competitive job.” Johns Hopkins University helps, too. So does the city’s growing tech and defense sectors, Kiplinger says.
The last in-depth study of downtown parking, produced in 2004, found 56,400 spaces -- 4,600 of them considered to be excess spaces, based on traffic between the peak hours of 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. on weekdays, according to consultant Desman Associates. Most of that surplus was on the fringes, along the lake, in the Flats and at the southern edge of the Gateway district.

These types of wounds, if formed at an early age, are literally hardwired into our brains. If they are from a trauma later in life, often Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) sets in. The flashbacks, pain and memories that are literally felt -- “psychic pain” one theology book I read years ago called them -- and cannot be let go of. Thus, the individual suffers at a profound level.

This is big foodie news for Prescott. Though Pok Pok Noi only has 11 seats and sidewalk seating, the location is meant to be mostly take-out. I only ate at Pok Pok once but the fish sauce chicken wings were worth the waiting to get a table.
"She's a blueprint of what I would like to become," White said. "She never takes anything negatively. She always makes it positive."
And so I did. With a bit of butter, milk, salt and pepper, I had a delicious vegetable dish with the consistency of mashed potatoes. The next night, I made it again (only this time on purpose). But instead of mashing by hand, I used the food processor to ensure an even smoother, mashed potato-like consistency. Adding a bit of cumin made it even better.
No doubt , Town Square might've put shopping on his mind.

Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine had argued that a referendum would require state officials to prepare for the 2012 congressional primary with an old congressional map that contains 18 districts, instead of the 16 that federal law will require Ohio to have after next year. He said use of the old districts would violate federal laws.

Skellig is going to have an impact on Michael's life, of course, but he's also not the answer to everything. In a nice move, the boy (Dean Logan) is equally changed by his new friend, the feisty Mina (Charlotte Sanderson) -- an arty girl home-schooled by her hippie mom and prone to quoting William Blake.
The sea creature that saved his life by circling beneath him -- he says it was a seal -- he now thinks of as an angel. Its appearance in the frigid water is not something he has talked about in public, although he has often appeared on television and been interviewed by reporters. He has never even told his mother.
In 1958, the court said: "The (Eighth) Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society." Justice Antonin Scalia has warned: "A society that adopts a bill of rights is skeptical that ‘evolving standards of decency' always ‘mark progress,' and that societies always ‘mature,' as opposed to rot." But even the "originalist" Scalia, although disposed to construe the Constitution's terms as they were understood when ratified, would today proscribe some late 18th-century punishments, such as public lashing and branding.
And yet, sure enough, when October 15th came around, of the 15 players that the Yankees were protecting, Mantle was not among them. While I don't know for sure what their reasoning is, it likely was a matter where they were unsure if Mantle was going to come back for 1969 or not. They knew he'd give it a try, but they did not know if it would actually happen. And if it did not, they would have "wasted" a spot protecting a player who was not going to play for them. So they gambled and left him unprotected. However, while Mantle was unprotected, they obviously did not want anyone to actually draft him. They contacted the front offices of the Seattle Pilots and the Kansas City Royals and asked them not to pick Mantle. They even enlisted the President of the AL, Joe Cronin, to put pressure on them not to take Mantle. After all, this was Mickey Mantle! How could he not play for the Yankees? The Pilots agreed and the Royals also agreed...at least at first.

Faulk was true to his word Saturday night at Fawcett Stadium. When he strolled out to center stage as the newest member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, surely there wasn't a Rams fan anywhere who didn't think he looked great - as great as he did wearing blue and gold for seven seasons in St. Louis.
The council takes roughly 7,000 votes a year on ordinances. Yet, since mid-2006, fewer than 100 votes were not unanimous, according to data compiled by the city clerk's office. During his entire 22 years in office, Daley used his veto only once.

Right fielder Carlos Beltran hit his second homer and had another hit as he raised his average to .356. "He looks great," Matheny said. "He's so effortless in everything he does. I think he's hitting his stride at about the right time." ... Outfielder/infielder Allen Craig took a day off from hitting and running and spent time in the gym strengthening his legs; he had surgery on his right knee in November. Hopeful of playing minor-league games before camp ends, Craig said his knee had felt sore after he got 10 at-bats in an afternoon a few days ago at Port St. Lucie, Fla., but the pain had dissipated. "I feel good," Craig said. "I had a rough couple of days after that day in St. Lucie and was a little sore. It wasn't a step back or anything, but it was kind of a reality check, because I was rehabbing for a month straight without any days off and hitting it pretty hard. I took a day off to recover and this was my first day back in the gym. Nothing really has changed since I got down here. You have a couple of days that are bad and then you come back and you're better than you were before." ... While Lynn took a Brett Hayes shot off his gloved hand in the big league game, prized righthander Shelby Miller, pitching for Memphis against a Marlins team featuring rehabbing regulars, tried to field a similar smash hit by power-hitting right fielder Mike (Giancarlo) Stanton. "I don't really get a lot of comebackers like that," Miller said. "Luckily, I got a glove on it and it didn't hit me."
As introduced, Colorado's proposal would require that the poorest readers be identified as soon as kindergarten and identified for grade retention.

"Everybody goes through ups and downs. Every player does. We tried to put him in a position to succeed. You guys saw it, saw what we did. It didn't work."
I started with a "cupping," which sounds vaguely lewd, but is a term for a formal coffee tasting. The Stumptown cafe lined up cups of java brewed from beans that varied by country, climate and color. The cupping process involves sipping with sharply indrawn breath, pulling air over the tongue to savor the flavors. Like wine tastings, I noticed subtleties only upon the manager's suggestion (leather? papaya?). Nevertheless, it was a fun way to learn about new blends while riding a hand-trembling caffeine buzz.

North Waziristan is a haven for Islamist militants from many parts of the world. It is also believed to be a key command and control center for insurgents fighting American troops in neighboring Afghanistan. The identities and affiliations of those killed Saturday were not immediately known.
"I had a couple slow starts and lost a little bit of confidence at the start (of the season)," Allen said. "It was tough. It was a learning experience for me. I'd never been a backup. Even (in 2010-11), I played 50 games. It was something I had to learn to do. I thought I was still playing well when Ben was there, but when he was traded to Ottawa, the opportunity was there for me. I played every game but one, I got 20 starts in a row, it was awesome. It was a great experience. I really relished it. Unfortunately we didn't make the playoffs, but individually, I couldn't ask for more."

The Bee's own review of the billing revealed substantial markups in bills charged to the library system. Our stories forced a response from the library, and by October 2007 the library released its own investigation, which revealed that administrators were warned of potential problems as early as November 2005. Library officials then announced they would take their investigation to police and the District Attorney's Office.

"Although this approach is indeed a 'headline grabber,' which Dublin journalists at the time jumped upon, a more valid approach to get real usage data is through the city's wastewater system," Mr. Paull says.

The film's lack of common sense reaches out-of-control proportions in the final minutes, as Ally races from wedding to wedding, searching for the man she has decided to spend her life with. "Why didn't I just go wait for him at his apartment?" she wonders. It's as if the character is pointing out just how lame the film is.

In Portuguese, it means "House of Cheese Bread," and the Ferry Street location is the lone New Jersey outpost of a 400-outlet fast-food chain based in Brazil. The big, puffy cheesy rolls are delicious — I’d buy a dozen and warm them up in the hotel room microwave afterward or the next morning. Good sandwiches here; I’d recommend the salada mista, with grilled chicken and steak, lettuce, tomato, green olive and hearts of palm.
The latest revenue projections for 2011-13, which are rough and subject to continuous change, show that if schools continue to get their current share of state funds, they will reap about $9 billion, or $900 million less than they calculate they need to tread water. That would put them about $2.9 billion below what the quality education model recommends.
1978-79 - Cotton Fitzsimmons, Kansas City
But Ravi's lawyer, Steve Altman, emphasized to the jury that Ravi was 18 years old, barely out of high school, when the alleged events occurred. Throughout his opening statement, Altman repeated over and over, "He's an 18-year-old boy," emphasizing the word "boy."
Fresh off their debut on HBO's series "24/7," an up-close preview of next month's Winter Classic, the New York Rangers will tote their stage to Scottrade Center tonight.
The health center, which is expected to open later this year, will house two primary-care doctors. There will be computer stations for the public and a fully equipped kitchen where a dietitian can lead cooking classes.

I've lived at my home for almost 20 years, and I've never been in trouble with the law. But they called the police because they said I had the car out too long.
All Arpaio has been able to muster is a meek reply. If there were any victims, I apologize to those victims, he has told media. Then he tried to claim that Democrats were out to get him. It's a political hit.
While people older than 75 make up just 1% of the nation's workforce, that age group accounts for the most dramatic rise in employment - a 158% uptick since 1990, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reports.
Witter, 39, a single mother, works as a nurse’s assistant at Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital. In addition to paying for day care and rent, she’s helping her son Ronald, 19, attend culinary school, and daughter Felicia, 21, pursue a nursing degree.
When a water main break in Strongsville last Wednesday caused a section of Pearl Road to collapse and become a sinkhole, the subsequent closing of Pearl Road and the interruption of water service in the city resulted in the closure of the Strongsville City Schools that day — and the cancellation of Wednesday’s scheduled baseball game between Strongsville and Mentor. When rain then postponed Thursday’s game against Willoughby South, Strongsville Coach Josh Sorge’s pitching rotation was thrown out of whack by the “off days.”
Facebook apps transform Facebook into a hub for all kinds of activity, from playing games to setting up a family tree. Apps are considered an important way for Facebook to extend the usefulness of its network. The company says 70% of users use apps each month.
Among the regional companies, there were a nearly equal number of companies in which CEO pay rose while corporate income fell, of companies in which CEO pay fell while corporate earnings rose, and of companies in which CEO pay fell, but by a smaller percentage than the drop in corporate profits.
"We never let a team score that many points on us," guard John Lucas said. "That's something that we, as a team, are going to have to step up and be like, 'That's not happening again.' I know we will."
Paula Mitchell, who owns Paula's Moms and Proms, has been catering to clients shopping for prom dresses and mother-of-the-bride looks for more than two decades. She and her daughter Hollie Mitchell, who buys many of the store's prom styles, share these suggestions on making the dress shopping process more pleasant.
At one table, a man wearing a fine leather jacket, big gold watch and giant aviator glasses — his version of "late Elvis"? — sweet-talks his flattered girlfriend over beef tartare with sesame oil and Asian pear. At another, three slender young Korean women with the appetites of stevedores talk and laugh over hot pot and barbecue, their chopsticks poised to beat each other out for the best morsels.
Wine and food lovers will delight in a spectacular Wine Dinner featuring the celebrated wines of Reverie Winery.
STILLHOUSE: Water murky; 70-74 degrees; 2.05' low. Black bass are good on watermelon trick worms, watermelon super flukes, and live minnows. White bass are fair on minnows and Li'l Fishies. Crappie are good on minnows and white tube jigs. Channel and blue catfish are fair on chicken livers and stinkbait. Yellow catfish are slow.
Both the U.S. and Europe have said they would rely heavily on Ms. Suu Kyi's advice when making their decisions.
“Shame” doesn’t do anything so stylistically daring, but it shows the same dedication to composition that McQueen (who began his career in the visual arts) showed then. Shots are held long enough to force us to really see everything in the frame (and then see it anew). Cuts are minimal, to avoid any distractions.
Officials with the state Department of Regulatory Affairs, which oversees the Banking Division, have refused to speak with The Post about New Frontier or even general approaches to regulation, citing the state law. They provided select answers to written questions about the department's staffing and policies.

Some military leaders had expressed concerns that repealing the ban could undermine unit cohesion. The repeal of the 18-year-old ban took effect last September.
Also, it made me realize that so much of what makes the subject of diversity uncomfortable is that it raises topics that people find awkward and anxiety-producing. No one likes feeling that way. We particularly don't like feeling that way if we think that seeing the other person's perspective concedes some wrongness on our part.
The kickoff will take place in the atrium of Cleveland State University's Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs.
At 6, he was a member of a Ball State youth dribbling group that performed at halftime. The year after that, he and his friends pretended to host basketball games in their basements, flicking the light switch on and off to mimic pregame introductions.
McMullen relieved, however, and drove OSU 93 yards to another TD on his first full series.
The timing suggests confirmation of what has long seemed evident: There is slim chance Josey could be ready to return this season from the injury he suffered Nov. 12 against Texas that Smith at the time characterized as "a tragic fluke - a one-in-a-million type of injury."
“You know Joba,” Cashman said. “He’s a healer. He gets hurt, but his ability to handle the healing process has always been significant, and we’re counting on that. He’s a man and he knows what the road ahead is, and he’s not afraid of it. His attitude is, ‘What do I have to do to get back?’ He knows there are a lot of people who care about him. He’s received a lot of well-wishes and prayers, and he’s thankful for that.”
The union has also criticized the recent decision by CSU trustees to approved salary increases for incoming Fullerton President Mildred Garcia and another system president by 10 percent each, the maximum allowed under a cap the board adopted in response to criticism over excessive pay raises. At the same meeting, trustees revealed that state budget cuts may force the system to eventually cut enrollment by up to 25,000 students and slash 3,000 jobs over the next two years.
A digital recording studio sparkles in the teen section -- welcoming adolescents to lay down poems, music and, perhaps, intergenerational histories. Almost alone in the nation, the library boasts a gigabyte of broadband for pin-sharp distance learning. Vending machines dispense coffee and snacks for consumption alongside the magazines and newspapers.
On the other hand, The Daily will have competition. The New York Times has a free iPad app, though it plans to begin charging a yet-undetermined fee early this year. USA Today has a free app and is overhauling its newsroom toward putting news on the iPad and other mobile gadgets. It has no plans to charge readers.
What if you find yourself in wine country but fancy something a little bit different?
Seau's ex-wife, Gina, told the Union-Tribune San Diego that he texted her and each of their three children separate messages: "I love you." She later confirmed to The Associated Press that Seau texted the family.
They were determined, indignant, inventive. Their solution -- Senate Bill 408 -- ordered utilities to turn over the amount billed as taxes to the government or return that money to the ratepayers.
As tiny as a single grain of rice, bedbugs hide inside furniture and bedding, which is why the sense of smell is a better weapon than sight. The average human has merely five million scent receptors in his or her nose; the average dog, 200 million to 250 million. Canines, which have been trained to sniff out everything from illegal drugs to gypsy moths, are capable of locating bedbugs with 97 percent accuracy, according to a 2008 study from University of Florida.

It will be Treasury's third sale of AIG stock. The sale is expected to raise around $6 billion. AIG said it planned to purchase $2 billion of the amount put up for sale.
Harris said he and the other vendors are anticipating the market opening for business “anywhere from mid-March to May 1.” However, he said they all want shoppers to be as pleased as possible upon first impression, and that takes time and attention to detail.
Of the 2.1 million returns the Internal Revenue Service flagged as fraudulent last year, 938,664 were the result of identity theft, according to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the office that audits the IRS' performance.
øIf so, say so.
So, he's happy with the progress, right?
"This was where I thought we could really play with the history of the Ailey company in a way that has never happened," Battle said. "We could not only reach out from the proscenium, but let people out there touch the spectacle in a sort of real life 3D way. The electricity in the audience keeps building as the audience members are esorted up to the stage, and it's a spiritual moment. As Mr. Ailey always said, ‘I believe that the dance came from the people and that it should always be delivered back to the people'. At a recent performance a woman lost her wig onstage, and when the dancer who was her partner whispered ‘I'm so sorry" she said, ‘I'm 70 years old and having the time of my life'."
Workman, meanwhile, is searching for a studio to release the film nationwide.
That, in turn, could hurt lease prices.
I've been told that if you really want to make sure nothing is ever accomplished, you should start a committee.
The "Smell Like a Man, Man" campaign, which Portland-based advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy created for Old Spice, has become a breakout hit, commanding millions of YouTube views, massive online buzz and awards fuss, including an Emmy nomination. The campaign's star -- the handsome Isaiah Mustafa -- has appeared on everything from "The Oprah Winfrey Show" to the "Today" show, and has signed a talent development deal with NBC, which could lead to him starring in one of the network's series.
Blessing wrote this play in 1999, by which time the firestorm generated by the National Endowment for the Arts' grants to four controversial individual performance artists (Karen Finley and Holly Hughes among them), as well as the funding of tax-supported museums exhibiting Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually graphic photographs, had subsided just a bit. But you can still smell the ache as well as the giddy delight in every sentence he wrote. And these days, even as politicians aim at larger targets, "Chesapeake" has the feel of a fresh wake-up call. (And, it must be said, Spalding Gray aside, Blessing, who is best known for his play "Into the Woods," writes far more brilliantly than the lion's share of performance artists around.)
"We're looking at that — that we could have a serial killer," Dormer said in response to a reporter's question.
The S&P 500 rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,402.50 at 9:51 a.m. New York time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 12.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,281.52 today.
The Rays struck back in the third off Mariners starter Blake Beavan, also via the long ball. After lumbering catcher Jose Molina reached on an infield single, Sean Rodriguez — hitting .182 — hit a laser shot to left-center for a two-run homer.
A review of security camera video, police said, also showed that the couple had stolen numerous items between March 27 and April 21.
ATLANTIC CITY — A New Jersey couple pleaded not guilty today in the carjack-killing of an Atlantic City casino patron.
In a statement released by the Rams, Williams said:
"She's no Don Quixote," quips former U.S. Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., a longtime family friend and onetime boss who says Wyrsch, a seasoned executive, won't tilt at windmills. "The wind group will be able to advance their cause in a way that would not be possible without her presence."
And then there's Broadway star-turned-country singer Laura Bell Bundy. She graced the red carpet wearing a spangled bathing suit, which would have been oh-so-very-Katy Perry of her, but she apparently made an attempt toward decorum by draping it with a bright blue skirt. And then thought, screw decorum, and threw the skirt aside like it was a curtain and her thighs were the opening act.
Pores: The gajillions of tiny openings in your facial skin that, if inspected under magnification, will make you want to wear a pillowcase over your head the next time you leave the house. Ranging in diameter from microscopic to large enough to stub out a cigarette in, the governing principle of facial pores is the same as it is for horse jockeys: the smaller the better.
"He was in a fight for his life," Fooks said. "And the result was Dr. Greenspan lost his."
Joe Weinberg, a managing partner and president for gaming at Cordish, said the new interchange will "function more safely and efficiently."

A House vote is expected Thursday and the Senate is likely to follow in time to meet a midnight Friday deadline before a stopgap funding measure expires.
Key state legislative leaders unveiled a bill Friday that proposes setting a target for the rate at which overall health spending should rise—a step that would once again put the state in the forefront of efforts to remake the American health-care system.
Wendell Maxey: The verdict is still out on Luke Babbitt, especially after he only appeared in 24 games and averaged under 6 minutes per game. But you at least have to applaud the kid for showing off his stroke down on the farm with the Idaho Stampede in the D-League and not getting caught with a loaded BB gun in his ride. If Portland needs to include his rookie contract in part of a bigger deal this summer, might as well move him. If not, at least Babbitt will know his way around Boise next season.
As for judging worthy contestants, Osbourne says her sympathies are well known: "With me, if there's an animal in the act, or a gay or a drag queen, they're through" to the next round. "It's not even a debate." But with Stern, "you can't call it."

"As school boards face heart-wrenching decisions on whether to cut PE or music, raise class sizes or eliminate school days, OSBA appears out of touch and even a bit irrelevant."
After Tuesday's close, Apple announced earnings for the first three months of 2012, and the mind-boggling numbers proved critics wrong. Apple brought in $39.2 billion in revenue for profits of $11.6 billion, or $12.30 per share on a diluted basis, easily beating analysts' projections of $10.04 a share on revenues of $36.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters research.
Wearing the veil has become popular in Tunisia and Egypt for a variety of reasons, including as an expression of religious identity, conforming to social pressures and as a statement against the secular authoritarianism of the government. (The irony is that Egypt is the birthplace of Arab feminism, which in the first half of the 20th century put much energy into unveiling women.)
Maybe so. But knowing Fisher, I doubt he would mind being mentioned in the same sentence with Hill. The two parallel one another, even in years at their schools. In a relatively short period of time in the NCAA universe, their programs have risen from obscurity to among the top 25 in the country. And it can be argued no two coaches at any level have done better jobs with their respective sports in this town as these men.
Shinji Kurita is a perfectionist, and diners with a taste for exquisite Japanese fare are the beneficiaries. His omakase dinners (reservations are required) have included stunning sushi, like keiji salmon and bluefin otoro. And the giant Madagascar prawn in black bean sauce is a marvel.
Russo, who has pleaded guilty to 21 corruption-related crimes, is now cooperating with prosecutors. While testifying in an earlier corruption trial, Russo said he once had influence with as many as 10 judges, but he did not name them.

Centrist leader Francois Bayrou dealt Sarkozy a new blow Thursday night. Bayrou said he would not give his voters specific guidance for Sunday's vote - but that he will cast a ballot for Hollande.
The other thing that will likely give consumers pause is the paucity of 4K content. Consumer have a hard enough time finding 3-D content to view on newer stereoscopic TVs, but they will have difficulty finding anything at all in 4K.
"You write children's songs -- what about this one?" McCartney said, launching into a new ditty about a yellow submarine.
"It doesn't matter in the big scheme of things if he's got the support of the fans or the administration," said Mike Vrabel, the NFL linebacker and former Buckeye who played with Fickell at Ohio State and remains one of his best friends. "In the short term, he's got to have the support of the players, and I'm pretty certain he does. That's what's important, that's what will get these guys through this time. As he does that, fans will start to realize what they've got and the administration will realize what they've got."
The council also interviewed Robert Bowman, the Harbor Springs resident and former state treasurer under Gov. Jim Blanchard who Gov. Rick Snyder and Mayor Dave Bing jointly selected for the board.
President Obama’s chummy open-mic exchange with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev yesterday sounded very much like his foreign-policy Etch A Sketch moment.
Mae was short and muscular. She had a blond streak in her short brown hair. She was extremely polite and enthusiastic.
Legislators' comprehensive annual financial disclosures will not be posted online, as proposed in the original bill sponsored by state Sen. Jamie Raskin.

Commissioners are considering new staff-recommended asking prices ranging from $22.5 million to $28 million for the century-old rotunda, 28-story tower and surrounding buildings at the southeast corner of East Ninth Street and Euclid Avenue.
I sent them this one entitled "Kith and Kin." It took me years to realize where it is an impossibility for me to " Call back the waters of the river" and to try avoid living the same old mistakes over again. At my present age, I don't have that kind of time left for recalling those old mistakes, so I continue on by making new ones.
Kean, who has been a political mentor to Christie, said the trip is vital to Christie’s ability to represent New Jersey, which has the second-highest population of Jews after New York among the 50 states, because it matters how American leaders react to threats to Israel.
"It’s really been a sea change in terms of tax burden for Massachusetts," said Josh Barro, the author of the study. "Massachusetts, even though it is spending significantly less per pupil in education than New Jersey, is managing to achieve clearly the country’s best educational outcomes."
Roos said that he commissioned the two-story, 360-square-foot mural out of desperation in 2007 after losing 24 buildings to eminent domain and fearing the loss of more.

They brought equipment that recovered images “depicting prepubescent children engaged in prohibited sexual acts on Breisacher’s computer,” the office said at the time of his arrest.
Yet the Kings know it's not nearly as simple as it looked in Vancouver and St. Louis. Anze Kopitar believes there's no chance of overconfidence against the powerful Blues when they return to Staples Center, where Los Angeles has lost six of its last seven postseason games.
Standing for hours a day at your desk might sound like punishment.

The bank is evaluating how the new technologies "can create value for advisers and the firm while at the same time having prudent supervisory and compliance oversight," said Paul Fox, head of Merrill Lynch Online Platforms. The bank is now running a limited pilot program with LinkedIn to allow clients to communicate with the bank.
"We're going to trial. We're going to fight it. She's not guilty. She hasn't done anything, so she's going to continue running for political office and living her life as normal," Carlos said Thursday. "The financial burden of her defending herself against these allegations is overwhelming at times, but she's sticking to her guns."
“You cannot educate this population without a lot of extra resources,” Myrtle said. “When you’ve got money and you’ve got a plan, you can do things. People have.”
"We're going to really emphasize a lot on how they derived on these cuts," Budget Committee Chairman Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen) said this morning. "Everybody was prepared for a 15 percent cut in their school aid. Why did it change at the 11th hour? Why was there no notice?"
called the response from the city’s top administrator, who essentially fired the initial contracting company, “perfect.”
But in the case of "The Fighter," not even a movie star helped. The story of boxer Micky Ward, his struggle for success and his tempestuous relationship with his half brother, Dicky Eklund, was hindered because it would likely carry an R rating, it was a drama targeted to adults, and it was expensive. In one iteration of the film, its budget hovered around $70 million, with Brad Pitt set to star opposite Mark Wahlberg, also a producer on the film, and Darren Aronofsky directing.

That put more money in his pocket but drove down the stock price again, setting the stage for another reverse split. He repeated this cycle - a reverse split followed by a torrent of new shares - five times in 2 � years.
"Perry is a longtime donor to many GOP causes, including the RGA, and trusts those candidates and organizations to make their own decisions about allocating resources," Jones said in a statement.
Whenever I get the chance to show love to a Diplomats member — whether it's a lowly alum like Un Kasa or the king of kings himself, Cam'ron — I'm going to do it. This is because the Diplomats (better known as Dipset) will go down as one of the best rap cliques of all time, a distinction that, at least for me, requires no second-guessing. It was the Dips' timeless hits, outsized personalities and the insane Harlem flair they brought to everything they did that made them rap's hottest crew for a few years. Before rappers were yelling "Swag!" every 15 seconds, the Diplomats did it without the tiresome reminding. It was just always there.
But Buffett said he avoids buying into businesses like Facebook because it's too hard to estimate what they might be worth.
Q: I read somewhere recently that after the triple-digit temperatures dip in the Valley, one can thrust a sharp spade all around a plant about 4-5 inches from the stem to bring renewed vigor to the plant and increase its productive life span throughout the fall. I suppose this makes a plant send out new, more vigorous roots? Can one do this with tomato plants, or should I take a less violent approach?
Managing to ignore the fact that the battle was only a temporary setback for Napoleon III, who soon conquered Puebla and ruled it until 1867, Mexicans began observing the battle's anniversary as a triumph of the indigenous people over foreign oppressors, and as a symbol of unity and patriotism. But the Batalla de Puebla, as it's still known in Mexico, has never inspired the heights of revelry seen on Sept. 16 (the country's true Independence Day). In fact, Cinco de Mayo isn't even a national holiday — except in two cities, where a battle reenactment anchors the celebration.
SOAR has two attorneys, including van der Harten, on staff as well as a paralegal and an accredited representative who can practice immigration law.

Final cut
Yates says other expansion plans include a new three-story garage, a new lobby and guest entrance, an outdoor dolphin-viewing area, a boardwalk and an expansion of the turtle rehabilitation area.
This means that getting to the top can be a fast ride. As Forbes showed in a 2011 analysis, John D. Rockefeller and Henry Ford each took more than two decades to hit $1 billion in net worth. Website founders like Bezos and Zuckerberg can do it in a matter of a few years. Priceline's Jay Walker needed just one year.
"It would probably make my life easier, so there is a little temptation on my side," Kightlinger told the U-T San Diego editorial board on Wednesday. "But all it means is we would probably be in court suing each other over our contracts with each other as opposed to our relationship with each other. … Unless we totally replumb the state … we are going to have some sort of relationship and make that work."

"Christian Louboutin has created one of the more iconic trademarks of the 21st century," argued attorney Harley Lewin, before a three-judge panel. "Louboutin turned a pedestrian item into a thing of beauty."
Wheless ruled that the injuries to Pilar Sanders, which she alleged her husband inflicted during an April 23 scuffle at their $5.7 million home in Prospect, were a result of Deion Sanders defending himself from her assault. Wheless said that since Deion Sanders experienced no pain, it was only simple assault, which is punishable by a fine.
As for his top player, Kapels, the coach doesn't know much about his background. This is not, after all, Division I college basketball. (Concordia belongs to neither the NCAA nor NAIA and is not bound by eligibility rules.)
"That seems kind of strange," he said. "I knew they were closing the plant, but I figured they would still sell them."

"College is tough," she said, "and not everyone has the same determination to finish what they start. To look back and see that I finished what I started, to me, that's worth celebrating!"
"The technology is about capturing movement, but also capturing depth -- and that's what Kubrick was all about," he says. "You see the depth in a film like 'Barry Lyndon,' and it makes you wonder what it would look like in 3-D."
State Issue 1 -- a four-year, $700 million extension of Ohio's Third Frontier program -- was earning 61 percent approval from voters, with 85 percent of precincts reporting.
Chef Brandon Jew's apartment? Not so much.
Most of all, I saw a man who was frightened with the prospect of losing a $10 million contract because of ignorance - not an apologist for the Cuban regime.
So why did he drop? Randle’s production wasn’t anything special this past season as he suffered from the struggles of the LSU quarterbacks. Randle caught 53 passes for 917 yards and eight touchdowns in 14 games for the Tigers, who lost the national title game to Alabama.
“You've just disproportionately impacted the most vulnerable children in our district without any community input,” said Isobel Stevenson, a parent at Lafayette's Pioneer Elementary, member of the District Accountability Committee and a former Boulder Valley principal. “That doesn't look very good.”
Given a nine-run lead before he took the ball for the start of the fourth inning, Jake Westbrook didn't waver from what's been his consistent M.O. this season.

ø"That's my opinion on how to make the cars and drivers able to do more - to put it in the drivers' hands," Edwards said. "I don't know if that'll make more exciting races, but it'll sure as hell make a guy able to go up through the field if he's got a fast race car, and I think that's exciting."

Superintendent Jim Schlachter seemed to have a similar reaction.
Even so, Hillman said, the failure to remove the soldier by now "shows that the system they are working in was failing."
Schuneman, who wrote "The First Apartment Book," due out in August from Random House, says many of his younger clients focus on the visual without considering the sounds, scents and feel of their living space. People often think decorating "is just about paint on the walls," he says, "but it's really about creating an experience."
That's correct. Four years. Two degrees. Roth earned an undergraduate degree in communications in three years. He then crammed 12 classes into two semesters and a summer and earned a master's in sports administration management. He picked up his diploma Friday.
Including one guy who owns a batting crown. Sanchez became the first player in major league history to double in his first three World Series at-bats, an attention-grabbing night that included a rope to left field in the fifth inning that scored the tiebreaking run.
"The firefighters and paramedics who lost their lives. It helps to put in proper language what the term 'hero' really means -- since sometimes we as a society tend to throw it around a bit, to the point that it has loss its true meaning."
Angry about your big grocery bill?
Some were defiant. "I'm gonna sue Burger King," co-owner Joe Delia growled. "I'm Italian. I'm tired of them selling the Whopper."

In the recap of last week, Maria and Derek have a backstage high-five failure. It's amusing. Despite myself, I'm kind of liking the almost brother/sister vibe these two have going on. Maria's most memorable year is 1988, when she was 10 years old. She says her parents were immigrants from Greece, working as janitors at Boston bars to support the family. Maria's dress during the interview part of the clip segment is SUPERCUTE. Maria explains that without money for babysitters, her parents would take the kids to work with them, and when she found change on the floor, she'd play Madonna's "Material Girl" on the jukebox. So now it's going to be a rumba, which must mean they're totally changing up the original tempo of the song. Oh, wow, they really are -- this is way more musically adventurous than the DWTS band usually gets. I'm kind of liking it. This is a sexy, sexy rumba, even if it's your typical slinky-slinky-pose-pose dance they do for rumbas. Bruno says he "felt it." And when Derek says "I did, too," Bruno responds with "I bet you did, you naughty boy." Bruno explains they danced the whole song to only the melodic line, that there was no rhythm in the song, and to dance to a song like that is incredibly difficult. When Bruno is impressed and quiet like this it's a major compliment. Len throws out the word "smoldering" and praises the technique.
Brown does have an appreciation for Backes.
When the interview moved to a San Rafael cafe near the rehab center she still visits, she explained her journey – including a near-death car accident and a more recent miscarriage – that “led me to a place of a lot of emptiness and loneliness that made me connect with Steve and not run as fast as I could away from him.”

Chiang, a fellow Democrat, won praise from the public when he cut off legislative pay last June using unprecedented powers under a 2010 voter-approved initiative, Proposition 25, in conjunction with a 2004 measure requiring a balanced budget.

scientists said they have found fish in the Gulf with open sores, parasitic infections and chewed-up fins -- injuries they suspect are from the effects of the petroleum.

Imagine a tree, a living, miniature olive tree, whose branches bear heavy, golden fruit shining like poisoned apples in the late-afternoon sun. The tree is a bonsai of sorts, gnarled and thick-trunked, rooted in a vessel that appears to have been fashioned from the earth itself. Not without difficulty, a man in a dark suit heaves it onto your table. You understand without being told that you are to pluck one of the glittery orbs and pop it into your mouth. Its skin, crisp and brittle, shatters under your teeth, releasing a complex brine, all ocean, sugar and decay, which fades to a subtly penetrating bittersweetness that lingers until it is washed away with a sip of cold wine. Does the substance of the fruit matter? The moment is sublime.

He confronted his teen-aged son, who admitted that he had taken the gun and "loaned" it to an acquaintance named Eric. Machino and his son went to Eric's apartment. There was no answer.

During service, Hollingsworth and a sous chef stand at the pass - where busers pick up the food and take it to the dining room - plating food and inspecting. Beyond the main kitchen are two other rooms where the commis - paid apprentices - and stages work on their prep list. They arrive at 5 a.m. and stay until they're done, 10 to 14 hours later. A band of windows wraps around the kitchen, and natural sunlight filters in, glinting off the hanging copper pots. Outside, lush vineyards rolled into the hills, but I was the only one looking.

The Supreme Court motion filed last week by the prosecutor's office argues: "The solution is remarkably simple and does not require this (Supreme) court to wade into the political maelstrom surrounding immigration policy. All that this court has to do is to allow (state) trial courts to consider an ICE detainer as a factor that may justify an increase in bail."

For the first time, defendant Will Lynch's attorney publicly conceded that his client pummeled the Rev. Jerold Lindner two years ago at the Sacred Heart retirement and medical center in Los Gatos.

"High fashion, real fashion, is quirky and eccentric. It does not lend itself to the broad strokes of TV," notes Simon Doonan, author of "Eccentric Glamour" and creative ambassador of Barneys. Perhaps that's why "Fashion Star," according to executive producer Jane Lipsitz of Magical Elves, is "about creating clothes for America. It's a really mainstream fashion show, and that's what fashion is these days."

A celebrated virtuoso -- and soloist at this work's premiere in 1896 -- he once said the Finale requires "fingers of steel." Not a problem for Thibaudet, whose fingers were a blur as he dispatched those final bullet-train flurries up the keyboard. It was dazzling. It was opulent. Just like that pendant on his neck.

"With all the development of the Llanos, we are creating a time bomb, which is the very high demand for workers. But no one is thinking about how to supply it," said Cauchopar executive Rodrigo Echeverri. "Offering workers the option to buy is the only way to guarantee a source of labor."

The plan is opposed by almost everyone: the Free Library of Philadelphia, which manages the local branch; the National Federation of the Blind of Pennsylvania; and 145 state legislators from both parties. Meanwhile, the Library of Congress, which produces all audio material, is seriously concerned about the loss of service. It upholds a national policy that prohibits transferring materials between network libraries. For now, Wilkins can't ship her blue digital books to Pittsburgh.
Boone is among those in competition to win the starting spot at right guard, which was occupied by Adam Snyder last year. Snyder signed with the Cardinals in the offseason, prompting the 49ers to look to Boone, 25, who has spent the past two seasons as a backup tackle, the position he played at Ohio State and St. Edward (Ohio) High School.
"Imagine a seesaw," Gordon said. "On one side is a transplant patient who rejects everything including their new face.

"I don't take it for granted that we'll get the fan vote. Anything can happen," he said. "The most important thing is just focusing on the points races, the races that matter toward the championship. When we get to All-Star weekend, however things are lined up is how things are lined up. It will be interesting being on the other side of the fence, trying to find a way into the race and going through that experience myself personally, to have an appreciation for what that is like versus just showing up and being locked in.

"I wouldn't say that we made up our mind to go in another direction. We drafted a young quarterback that we think can come in and play right away, he has that type of maturity, but we're not just going to hand him the football. There's going to be a competition as always and as it should be at every position. The quarterback position is talked about the most on any team but I love Colt McCoy. I still love Colt McCoy but I will always try and do what I think we have to do to make the team better and to improve ourselves. We had a chance to get a veteran, not a veteran although he is 28 years old, but a mature quarterback who has a chance to come in with that maturity and contribute right away. Whether that happens or not we have to let it play out. We have to let them compete. We have to let them play and see what happens. The fact that we drafted him so high means that we like him but we also like Colt McCoy and we like Seneca (Wallace) as well."

There are archetypal ideas in Hood's design for the land around this unusual building. He has paths, mounds, patterns and holes, says Fraker. "It is sympathetic to what an artist like Andy Goldsworthy likes to do. Walter's wall studies come from crumbled walls and how nature captures them."
“If Scott Brown has questions about Elizabeth Warren’s well-known qualifications -- from her high marks as a teacher to her nationally recognized work on bankruptcy and the pressures on middle class families – he ought to ask them directly instead of hiding behind the nasty insinuations of his campaign and trying to score political points. Once again, the qualifications and ability of a woman are being called into question by Scott Brown who did the same thing with the Supreme Court nomination of Elena Kagan. It’s outrageous.”
“As a matter of law,’’ she said, “most states won’t award damages if a healthy baby is born.’’

Mix a spoonful of the beaten egg white into the melted chocolate and yolk mixture to lighten it enough to accept the rest of the white; fold in the remaining whipped egg white.
RHP Poll Pick: This position is a test of fence-sitters everywhere. There is no wrong answer, and apparently there is no right answer. I went with Tom Seaver*. When I first made out my list of the greatest living players, Seaver was one of the first names removed. Fast-forward a few days of research and Seaver was back on the trusty yellow legal bad, listed behind the likes of Bob Gibson, Bob Feller, Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens. The more I looked, the more support for Seaver I found. I eventually sided with an ESPN poll of his peers that named him the best, and the influence he had over the next wave of starting pitchers. Still, there's a number of ways to go here. If you go with peak years, you can side with Gibson, Seaver, or Feller, the oldest living Hall of Famer. If you go with longevity and total numbers, Ryan's you're guy. If you go with the dominant heft from an entire career, then hold your nose and pick Clemens. Greg Maddux deserves some attention. And that's why I leave it up to you to pick. Click away. Active candidates: None like these guys.
"We set up close together," Carney said. "We play the same way we've always played."
"This is not a national diet that will be over in a couple months," said Marks, adding that the goal is to see the nation's weight levels return to where they were in the 1970s. "We hope we're seeing that that's starting to happen, but it hasn't happened in any state yet."

As we know, the first two games of the Western Conference semifinals haven't gone well; not much of anything has gone right. The Blues lost two at home to the Los Angeles Kings getting outscored 8-2 after scoring the first goal of the series. The Kings' stunning wipeout of the Blues in Game 2 looked like a demolition. It left the Blues angry and embarrassed, and left their fans feeling shocked and sad.

In Israel, security figures carry clout well into retirement. Although they frequently pursue political careers, Diskin had been seen as relatively apolitical, perhaps lending his words even greater weight.

Please don't say "reduce waste." Minneola has fewer employees than other cities its size and already spends less per resident than those cities, said City Manager Mark Johnson, who voluntarily took a pay cut when he arrived six months ago. And when you've cut government by 20 percent, you've liposuctioned the fat and are busy sucking out the muscle.
It was a pretty candid answer for a guy who doesn’t give many of them. Manning is years from his last snap, but he’s also not a young quarterback anymore. He just turned 31. He is finishing his eighth year in the NFL with his best statistical season, throwing for 4,933 yards and 29 touchdowns.
He's also already bracing for months of questions about the quarterback position.

"Short and totally boring." You're in trouble if that's how you'd describe your last romantic encounter. But if you're talking about a hospital stay, those are four perfect words.

Though the show billed as "A Party based upon the Gospel according to St. Matthew" had played off-Broadway, theater trustees balked. "We were very skeptical," recalled Dorothy Teare. "A rock musical based on the Bible? It will never go in Lakewood." But the heavy hippie happening, penned by Berea's John-Michael Tebelak, became one of the Festival's biggest hits of all time.
Four Patriots receivers topped the 50 reception mark this season — Wes Welker, Gronkowski, Hernandez and Deion Branch — but coordinator Bill O’Brien’s use of the twin tight ends has confounded defenses. The Patrtiots rarely line up without both players on the field, with Hernandez sometimes out wide or in the backfield and Gronkowski hugging the linemen. The duo’s 169 combined catches set an NFL record for a pair of tight ends.
2:40 p.m.: Attorneys are conferring with Judge Adams.
Of course, such nefarious plans don't always work. We know that the producers and judges had marked Lauren Alaina early on as their chosen candidate last season, so they tried to slow the Scotty McCreery freight train by having him sing first four times. Same with Lee DeWyze, who got the death spot four times in a vain attempt to lift Crystal Bowersox.
Some quarterbacks will certainly emerge but it's not just our list lacking QBs. In both the Rivals250 and the 247sports Top 247 national rankings, neither recruiting website listed a Florida quarterback for their intial 2014 prospects list.

Regular readers know I despise this sort of vile sexualization of girls. It's deplorable that their parents allowed their daughters to exploit their prepubescent bodies this way. But, what I want to know, what kind of justification process do all the adults involved in this production go through? Adults put on the show, choreographed the dance, ordered the costumes, drove the kids to rehearsals and performances. This wasn't the failing of one parent with bad judgement. No, there was a crew of adults involved.

Hardin did manage to raise before the jury the issue as to whether Clemens' testimony at the hearing was truly voluntary -- suggesting that Clemens might have been subpoenaed had he had not agreed to appear. Hardin also had a suggestive response when Barnett had trouble recalling certain facts about the hearing. Hardin quipped, "Memory's difficult sometime, huh?" -- perhaps to set the stage for later in the trial when witnesses are to testify about events of more than a decade ago.

A more direct explanation has to do with the basic requirements of movie storytelling.

With the exception of one (accidentally strenuous) hike, we spent most of our days lying on the beach. The approach is not encouraging — a quarter-mile path down a scrubby hill — but the reward is a stretch of soft white sand and placid, jewel-colored water. The sea is cool enough to be refreshing but warm enough that even a temperature wimp like me can walk right in. On either side are rocky coves, with smooth gray boulders that look as if they have been placed specifically for a high-fashion shoot. At sunset, the sand begins to glow hot pink, a result of crushed pink shells that have washed ashore. Lounge chairs are available for about $7 per day, but never once did anyone come by to collect money. (The Greeks, not the Germans, are clearly in charge of the waterfront.)

“Eat Heavy’’ announces a neon sign atop the Ticktock, North Jersey’s most famous diner. Open 24 hours in true Jersey diner tradition, the Ticktock has gone through several transformations, from cozy, classic ’50s diner to a gleaming, red-trimmed, multimillion-dollar diner of the present and future. The showy, spacious Ticktock does not set off any culinary fireworks, but it’s solid and dependable like the family car. When you’re hungry, it does the job. The menu is typically encyclopedic, with everything from nachos, popcorn shrimp and mozzarella sticks to burgers, club sandwiches (maybe the best item here), steaks, seafood and desserts. Eat heavy — or light; there are plenty of salads and healthy options on the menu. The 24/7 diner is a dying breed in the nation’s diner capital; only diners on busy highways can afford to stay open around the clock. Kudos, then, to the Ticktock, for its neon sign blazing right through the night into another Jersey morning.

Paired with skinny, salty fries with a tender crunch ($3), the burgers raised this all-American combo up a few notches.
After my girlfriend and I split up, I wrote a creative nonfiction piece about our breakup (changing some identifying details). I published it on a popular blog and linked to it on Facebook. We’re back together, and things are great; however, she saw the story and was humiliated. I explained that what I wrote was beautiful and vulnerable and true, and many people were moved by it. She really wasn’t down with that and told me to consider her off-limits in my writing. This seems unfair. I write nonfiction. What will I write about if I can’t write about my life?
Part 1:
The win came over Overfelt 19-7. The Dons had 15 hits and took the win in only five innings. Jennifer Roeder was perfect, going 5 for 5 with a double and driving in five runs.

Melissa Lalisan belted a hit and drove in three, Emily Lansing ripped a triple and had an RBI and Amanda Teixeira smacked a single. Katie Hannum and Milena Vukcevich each drove in runs for the Dons.

"I hope our students are able to see that Coach Adelman had some serious consequences in the press, our baseball coach is no longer working here and our football coaches will not be at the game and are facing some pretty serious investigations," Chapman said. "With the privilege of being on a team, comes additional responsibility. I hope that carries with them."

Each clinic meets twice a month, and the hourlong sessions include one-on-one instruction. "It focuses on each child's individual need," Certner said. "Even though there is a huge age range (4 to 14), each of their athletic and social levels are being met."
I've already lost my home to foreclosure. Can I get any help?
We had two Alicia Keys songs tonight. Now it's Lady Gaga's turn, as Skylar takes on "Born This Way." Skylar is definitely on a roll from last week: She takes the song and turns it into a personal declaration about being a country singer competing on "American Idol." With this vocal, she becomes the girl to beat this week.

The berm construction is the corps' quick response to a rapid rise and fall of the river, but shouldn't be a setback to the schedule for completing the levee repair by March 1, 2012. Pogue said the corps wants to finish interim fixes like the berm as quickly as possible to give Mississippi County farmers confidence and future ability to get a crop out of the floodway.
The service also offers a few interesting new features, including a screen displaying the least expensive days to fly and a variety of ways to search for flights, such as by price and destination.

"Attenberg" takes its title from a character's mispronunciation of the name of nature filmmaker David Attenborough. Tsangari had come to realize Attenborough's work in many ways captured the exact tone she wanted for her own film — an observant, anthropological detachment but also a tenderness and understanding.
How would the club teach its lessons? Would the audience participate? Would they take off any items of their clothing? What tools would be used to conduct procedures?
There are moments in our kid's lives, however, that are true kairos moments-times when something spectacular breaks through. Time in the ancient Greek world was expressed with two words: "kairos," and "chronos." The former was used to describe every day, moment-by-moment experiences. But "kairos" expressed a moment of rare opportunity. Kairos moments are those times when everything meshes together in amazing synchronicity. Sunday afternoon was one of those moments for our family. It was a moment of profound spiritual insight.
"To ensure proper administration of the March 2012 congressional primary, Ohio's sixteen congressional districts must be finalized before Dec. 7, 2011," DeWine's brief said.
This larger and more casual trattoria space had already earned a major following in the hands of partner and chef Jeff Michaud, 34, himself a James Beard award winner. It has my nod as the city's second-best Italian (after Vetri itself, where he was a former chef). And in the five years since it opened, it has come to embody the rustic spirit that predominated when Vetri first opened, from the marvelous roasted-vegetable antipasto, to the gossamer sliced prosciutto, soulfully braised rabbit, spit-roasted suckling pig, inventive seasonal pastas, and wood-fired pizzas that set the standard for our current pizza craze.

While Eisenbeis' track record pins him as a doubles hitter -- he led the legion team with 16 two-base hits -- when Festus was in a jam last week, he delivered a blast of power. In the eighth inning of its first-round regional game with Festus trailing Tupelo, Miss., by a fistful of runs, Eisenbeis ignited a seven-run rally when he slugged a three-run homer.

Not so long ago, travelers could still feel smug about bailing out of Cancún to explore the empty white-sand beaches, arrested-in-time fishing villages, Maya ruins and hidden cenotes on the unspoiled Caribbean coast to the south. What a difference 10 years makes: The Cancún building frenzy and relentless upscaling has seeped south, turning the Riviera Maya, as the northern half of Quintana Roo's coast was branded in 1999, from jungle backcountry to a string of resorts with just as many hotel rooms as Cancún.
The log truck driver’s name was not immediately available.

"This is an issue that just four to five months ago was not on the food industry's radar," said Paul Shapiro, vice president for farm animal protection at HSUS. "Now it's firmly cemented into the mainstream in a way that I think few people would have imagined.
It is not the profusion of wild flowers, the gently swaying grasses or the golden sun on Half Dome that brings most people to Yosemite in summer, at least, not in my experience. As a kid, this is when I first experienced California's favorite national park.
Tim Kaine, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said in a post-election statement that voters "sent a message that change has not happened fast enough."

"Most definitely, yeah," Howard said Tuesday as he cleaned out his locker at Joe Louis Arena, four days after the Wings' first-round playoff exit. "It's definitely one of the things that I'd be proud to be able to do, and this is one of the stepping-stones to possibly getting my name in the hat."

"Recognizing how competitive he is, and how much he still loves the game itself and from his great memories of New York, from that standpoint I wouldn't be surprised," Fisher said. "But I would be surprised from a quality-of-life standpoint. I'm just not sure if physically where he left off if he has, or wants to have, the energy that's required to run an NBA team and the travel and everything that comes with it. I just don't know if that's where he is in his life overall right now."

Union County MusicFest and Union County Rhythm and Blues by the Brook have been canceled for 2012 due to budgetary constraints, the Union County Board of Chosen Freeholders announced today.
Oh, I could go on about more easy-to-grow plants that often are overlooked. I suspect it's the lack of name familiarity, because these are not new designer plants. They've been around, like Helleborus. It wasn't that long ago that hellebores were considered exotic; now they are the darlings of our late-winter gardens, and rightfully so.
This was a homecoming for Brown, who plays Shirley on “Community,” the Thursday series about a band of misfits at a community college. Brown is a class of 1989 graduate of Warrensville Heights High School. She was inducted into the school’s hall of fame in 2009.

It was Philadelphia's first even-strength goal since Giroux scored one 27 seconds into the third period of Game 3.
"You're standing there at attention for hours and then you have to bring this cold mouthpiece up to your lips  that's when you ask yourself: 'What am I doing out here?' "
"The reason we felt he really got away from us the last game was our pick-and-roll coverage was not great," Brown said. "We didn't have a lot of help on the back side. One of the things we really kept harping on to our guys was transition defense. We had to limit Ty Lawson's aggressiveness. Our team defense tonight in the pick-and-roll situations was a lot better, and in my opinion that was the difference in our slowing him down."
There are more than 300 local high school graduates playing college baseball this season. They are spread out among 36 states across the nation.
"The best way to stop and eventually reduce childhood obesity has yet to be discovered," the authors wrote. But their study did identify several age and ethnic groups whose problematic patterns of consumption and sedentary behavior may need stronger medicine to change. Poorer fitness and body composition scores were consistently seen in counties with lower incomes and higher levels of unemployment. African Americans and Latinos had less lean body composition score than Asian and non-Latino white kids and lagged behind those groups in measures of abdominal strength and trunk extensor strength (basically, the ability to lift the upper torso off the floor).

"I do believe there are some guys in here who can steal some bases," said Matheny. "Now do you take a whole team and all of a sudden try to turn them into basestealers? No, you play the hand that you're dealt. Why force that issue?
Today, the upside for venture capitalists is limited because far fewer companies are going public in big stock offerings. The bar is much higher after dot-com era debacles like Pets.com. Before underwriting a deal or buying chunks of stock, banks and investors want to see millions in annual revenue and established customer bases. It's tough for younger tech companies to meet those standards.
At times he appeared to revert to his role as chief executive of Bain Capital, the Boston-based financial services firm, as when he demanded of a business owner complaining about his taxes, "Are you an LLC or a Sub-S?" (He was referring to different legal categories of companies.)
A criminal complaint was filed today in Superior Court, charging ex-Marine Andrew Urdiales, 45, with the Jan. 18, 1986, murder of Robbin Brandley, 23, who was stabbed 41 times in the college parking lot during a robbery.
Is all of this enough to freshen a well-known story? Not always. Sometimes the over-familiarity and the play's traditional proscenium staging make the action feel slow. But Riordan and her cast and crew have fashioned such a fine-tuned -- and finely attuned -- version of this classic Northwest tale, the slow parts are almost welcome as opportunities to reflect on the distinctively Northwest issues and attitudes embodied onstage.
MORRISTOWN — A young girl’s changing accounts of whether her father deliberately drowned her mother in the family bathtub became a key point of contention Tuesday when attorneys gave closing arguments in Kleber Cordova’s murder trial in Superior Court in Morristown.
It's unclear whether the inaccuracy originated with Thompson or someone else at Yahoo. But Thompson's bio with dual degrees periodically cropped up before he joined Yahoo. He was listed with a computer degree on a website touting his appearance at the Web 2.0 technology conference in 2010 while he was running eBay Inc.'s PayPal payment service. The computer science degree also has appeared in Thompson's bio in connection with his 2008 appointment to a Silicon Valley startup, Zuora.
It must be a challenge to come up with a steakhouse concept that doesn't overdo the macho element and overcharge for grilling meat. The food is mostly good, but this rating is downgraded mostly due to price.
"China's auto companies are still very committed to being global players, and they are not small companies -- several of them make 300,000 to 500,000 units a year," said Wale, president and managing director of the GM China Group. That's big enough to attract high-quality global suppliers and design partners, he added.

Third, the OAS study may include decriminalization of marijuana among its "menu of options," encouraging more presidents to join the pro-decriminalization camp. The OAS, which has not been doing a good job defending democracy or human rights lately, may take its drug policy mandate seriously -- if anything else, to become more relevant.

On a lunch outing a few days earlier, we passed on the four salad options, were tempted by the "two-day slow-cooked French onion soup" and settled for a world-class burger with fresh-cut, skin-on french fries and house-made ketchup, and a luscious grilled-cheese sandwich ("croque") with chopped braised shortrib.

One tool is the state's findings-for-recovery database, which was launched in 2004 to track money owed because of misspending in schools, cities and other branches of government. Anyone who winds up on the list can't be awarded a state contract until the money is paid back or otherwise accounted for. But employment contracts, such as for a school treasurer, aren't covered.
In fiscal year 2011, ICE deported 5,305 undocumented immigrants in New Jersey. There have been no removals as a direct result of Secure Communities since its activation in New Jersey about two months ago, ICE said.

The 20-year-old has signed with William Morrow to publish "Not Afraid of Life," to come out this summer. Morrow, an imprint of HarperCollins, announced Tuesday that the memoir would provide "an inside look at her life."
These crimes must be punished, but these offenders are not hard-core, cold-blooded criminals. In fact, to work at the mansion, an inmate must be classified as minimum-security by the Department of Corrections.
Pettitte did not attend the hearing. But he told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in an affidavit that he had a conversation in 1999 or 2000 in which Clemens "told me he had taken human growth hormone.

In interviews with The Bee last summer, Manning described her conflicted feelings about her adoptive mother and acknowledged making efforts to stay in touch with her.
But the ACPBL, despite its name, is not "the pros" as he sees it. It's not Poland, where he played for a month last fall — and played well, too — before leaving in a move he now somewhat regrets. It's certainly not Erie, Pa., where he tried out for theD-League's BayHawks team before being cut in November.
For nearly two years, outfielders Bryce Harper and Mike Trout often have been mentioned in the same breath.
"I think it's going to be a great way to challenge myself and experience a whole different level of competition," Mattox said. "It's been really neat to learn from the coaches and all the people on the team the different style of training, and just that love for track.

But Rio's Olympic-scale ambitions are acting as a catalyst. Consider a project, called Porto Maravilha or Marvelous Port, which was in city plans for years. Officials have wanted to turn 1,350 acres—about 1½ times Manhattan's Central Park—of rundown waterfront warehouses into a promenade of parks, office space, museums and cruise-ship docks. To do it, engineers from a consortium of firms including Odebrecht and OAS must dismantle about 2½ miles of elevated highway and relocate it underground.
One point of negotiation between Facebook and the FTC was over the length of time a third party would be required to audit the company's privacy settings, said one person. Facebook wanted just five years, and the FTC wanted a 20-year commitment.
Stan Humphries, the only quarterback to get the Chargers to the Super Bowl, thinks back to the 1994 season opener at Denver, which San Diego rallied to win 37-34. John Elway and the Broncos had the ball at the San Diego 3-yard line with less than a minute left.

But the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals criticized Brown for using his fame to peddle pups when there are so many animals in shelters without good homes. “This is a moneymaking scheme, and Brown will count the suckers who fall for it as he counts the money on the way to the bank,” a PETA spokesperson tells E! News. “Shelters will count the bodies in the barrel.” (PETA has previously slammed Brown for wearing fur.) The Los Angeles chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals also criticized Brown for such "backyard breeding."

Ficano said that he respects, the ruling, but says it is being mischaracterized as severances when in fact they are separation agreements that were offered to over 200 county employees, Ficano said in a statement. These agreements have saved the county $2.6 million in taxpayers dollars, and are similar to those offered in the automotive industry and to the state's teachers."
California will be best-prepared financially for a major earthquake when the majority of its property owners have affordable earthquake insurance. This will ensure that Californians receive fair compensation for damages incurred the next time a disaster strikes without the need for federal emergency funds. To this end, we have joined together to introduce H.R. 3125, the Earthquake Insurance Affordability Act, which aims to make earthquake insurance more affordable. We are joined in this effort by a number of California Republican and Democratic Members in both the House and Senate.

Third Rail's status is being cemented right now with its current production, British playwright Terry Johnson's very dark comedy "Dead Funny," its first play in the World Trade Center Theater, formerly home to the late, lamented Portland Rep. A pitch-perfect presentation of tricky, emotionally complex material, "Dead Funny" feels like a definitive Third Rail show. If nothing else, True performing one first-act scene wearing absolutely nothing but his socks is further evidence of how far these folks are willing to go to deliver a story as fully as possible.

Under the 1st Amendment, they add, any ambiguity should be resolved in her favor. This would be a harder case to make to the court if Stewart had been openly contemptuous of her conviction or if she had said she would violate the law in the future; the judicial system long has taken remorse (or its absence) into account when it comes to sentencing.

The appeals court needs to make sure that the harsher punishment wasn't a reaction to Stewart's assertiveness or her ideological identification with her client.

In the front garden is a glen of California live oaks, visible from the street. Sarkissian considers it "one of the most interesting things we've done." A bit of open space lightly mulched with oak litter separates the glen from lovely specimen shrubs -- manzanita, sugarbush, white sage, and in the heart of this garden, a gorgeous flannel bush (Fremontodendron), and a western redbud. The flowers of the flannel bush are used as mulch, and the redbud is "encircled by its own red-hued leaves," Sarkissian says. Paths run through the plantings, along with the dry creek bed. These plants are only hand-watered monthly in summer.

øSadly, it's too late to negate the tax bill by reversing the conversion. Taxpayers have the option of undoing a Roth conversion through a process called recharacterization, but the deadline for recharacterizing a 2010 conversion was Oct. 15, says Maria Bruno, analyst for the Vanguard Group. "The bottom line is that the tax is due," she says. "There's not much you can do."
Going to a therapist helped shape Knowles' lyrics. "You end up just talking and listening to yourself. Obviously, it is much more intimate and personal than a stage, but for me therapy is a way to really get to the heart of who you are. Sometimes a phrase will come up in a session, almost like a mantra." These mantras found their ways into his lyrics.

But even with the sharp wit, echoes exist of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, and love in the time of terrorism is not easy in New York City.

Call No. 3: I have a son.
"Inside Deep Throat" was produced by Brian Grazer, whose introduction to the once outrageous, now rather quaint blue blockbuster came, fittingly, via his grandmother. It was directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato ("The Eyes of Tammy Faye," "Monica in Black and White"), who have a nose for sniffing out consequence in the outwardly ridiculous. The documentary doesn't plumb the depths of the movie that inspired it (there are none) so much as it explores the uses to which it was put by interests as diverse and contradictory as the Nixon administration, a newly politically active Christian right, the mob, lefty feminist activists and the then-burgeoning porn industry. It examines "Deep Throat's" lasting cultural effect and finds it to be not unlike the fertile crescent of the modern culture wars. Both the current zeal to legislate "moral values" and the cynical modern porn industry can be traced to the same event — the release and unlikely success of what must be the pluckiest and dumbest, in a cute way, porn movie ever made.

But delve you should. Mild and creamy chicken korma ($11.99) is a crowd pleaser (come on, kids, just try it), the coconut chicken ($12.95) a little more kicky and intriguing with its chewy bits of grated coconut.

The vibe: Upon walking into the rich, dark, upscale bar area, the first thing you will probably see is a bunch of very nice dark suits. Morton's Steakhouse is just blocks from the Capitol. However, you will also see a couple of football and/or basketball fans, some guests waiting for a table in the dining room and, of course, their regulars. Completely separate from the dining room, the bar area has plenty of seating at high tables, a couple of cozy booths and comfy chairs surrounding the bar.

I talked to Duane, who was laid off at a packaging company, is now learning how to operate high-tech machinery. Andrea lost her job as an HR analyst, but she's now getting certified in the fast-growing field of electronic medical records. David, who in addition to being a truck driver for 23 years was also a Marine, so we know he can do the job -- he's here to retrain for a higher-paying job. And you just heard from Bronson, who was laid off two years ago, and you heard what he said.

So he's going to be learning hands-on machining over the next few weeks, after having already done some of the bookwork.

Nevertheless, the relationship between the sexual and the sacred has existed for thousands of years. And if ErosFestNW in Portland is any indication, the mix still has a distinct appeal.

The chow: Everything is made from scratch in-house except taquitos and tortillas. El Delfin marinates its tortillas, making them moist, flavorful and distinct.

I found the rough, rickety and rundown Leap-the-Dips at Lakemont Park to be the perfect throwback to the golden age of coasters, when thrills were raw and wild rather than neutered by lawyers and lawmakers.

I don't know about all of that. I need to be convinced that if the tournament expands to 96 teams why the first weekend of the tournament will still be as fascinating as it is now. My greatest fear is that if the NCAA isn't carefully monitored the added weekend of games will be nothing more than a glorified elimination tournament of the mid-majors or an excuse to continue to dump even more power-conference teams into the field no matter how lousy their regular-season records might be.

All government officials should strive to act in the best interest of the communities and the people they represent. Efforts are often hindered by petty politics, but the barrier in instituting change should never be for lack of conscience.

Students from Fran Quartini's second grade class and Seva Steel's eighth grade class buddied up to do their share to help the threatened snowy plover that winters at the beach. They pulled the ice plant, which was led by volunteer and Ocean Shore parent Kathy Kellerman, then a scavenger hunt with naturalist Margaret Goodale, who made a game of identifying debris on the beach, which included litter cleanup.

In 2010, an appeals court ordered a new trial after it found Conforti allowed prosecutors in the first trial to elicit testimony on "prior bad acts" of Foglia that were irrelevant to the murder charge, and such evidence may have prejudiced the jury.
Westlake police said they had been called to the Cooke residence on alarms four times since December. If true, that's a nuisance.

"Anyone who is paying attention would agree that Whitman is highly ambitious and aggressive," said Jennifer Chatman, a professor of leadership at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business.

The shakedown aspect of the scandal is an old one: Government officials of all stripes target contractors for campaign cash, because they're the most likely to contribute, and contribute heavily. It's not against the law, but it's sleazy, and it contributes heavily to the perception that the fix is in with government contracts. Frankly, given the swirl of scandal dancing around Ficano already, he can't afford to indulge practices that have even a whiff of impropriety.

At last count, redevelopment agencies were getting 12 percent of the property taxes paid in the state – more than $5 billion a year. This meant billions less was going to education than otherwise would have been – and the state's costs to “backfill” K-14 districts for the property taxes lost to redevelopment exceeded $2 billion annually, the Legislative Analyst's Office said. Critics argued that cities misused the money for projects favoring developers, or failed to deliver, or hoarded millions in reserve accounts (or all of the above).

The IRS filed a $219,241 lien in August for unpaid 2008 taxes. It filed a second lien for $72,930 in December for unpaid 2009 taxes. It's unclear how much money, if any, Hayes has paid toward the liens because Hayes refused to answer questions.

If you'd asked me these questions in the early hours of Oct. 4, as I slumped in a chair sipping cola and waiting for my nausea to subside, I might have rued the day I forked over $125 for the chance to run myself into the ground. Now, though, after I've caught up on sleep, rested my legs and rehydrated, all my memories are fond.
"We never try to reach in the draft," Giants general manager Jerry Reese said in a news conference last week. "We're conscious of what we think our needs are, but we try to pick the best player in the draft. We do try to fill holes in free agency when we get an opportunity to do that, but we never say let's get a certain position in the draft. We just try to pick the best player."

That has been the case every month since March, when the new casino opened in the Lemay area of south St. Louis County.

The disclosures are political gold for the Obama administration, transforming Brown from a champion of individual liberty into an exemplar of a problem the new law was designed to address. Uninsured and underinsured Americans rack up about $60 billion in medical bills every year that they cannot afford, forcing doctors and hospitals to pass those costs on to federal taxpayers and those patients who can pay their bills. It's not impinging on personal freedom to ask people to cover their own medical tabs. The mechanism Congress created to do that is the individual mandate.

Dan Porat was transfixed by the photograph of the little boy, thrust from the Warsaw ghetto by Nazis, their guns pointed at the women and children, the little boy's hands held in the air. It is a powerful image, testimony to the cowardice and cruelty of the Nazis. The photo was taken in spring 1943 and appeared in the Stroop Report, named after SS Gen. Jürgen Stroop, who organized the massacre and ordered the subsequent document. There were 125 copies of the Stroop Report, with the words "The Jewish Quarter of Warsaw Is No More!" emblazoned on the cover. It contained many photos, including the one of the boy, 7 or 8 years old, with the caption, "Pulled from the bunker by force." For Porat it is a kind of ground zero — he moves outward from the photo to identify the moment, the generals and soldiers who engineered the destruction of the Warsaw ghetto and the people in the photographs. He follows the lives of two Jewish children, the boy and a teenage girl, and three Nazi criminals, including Stroop, before and after the war. A reader goes back, again and again, to the 60 photographs that accompany the text. It is like pinching one's skin after a dream to see if one has woken in the same world in which one went to sleep. Or first opened "The Boy."
The coolest-looking tasting room in Arizona is in downtown Jerome. It's the home of Caduceus Cellars, the label of Maynard James Keenan, a nearby resident and lead singer of the band Tool.

But these are serious wines.
At flea markets and secondhand stores, she scouts for antique French linen. Amora mustard from a French supermarket tastes much better than the French mustard sold here, says Brennan, and it costs almost nothing. Be open to serendipity but realistic about how you cook at home. "I did bring home a snail grilling rack," admits Brennan. "How irresistible is that? I think I've used it once, but I just had to have it."

Jerusalem has always invoked deep emotions, slogans and wishful thinking. When Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at AIPAC's conference in Washington two weeks ago, repeated the mantra that "Jerusalem will always be united," he received a standing ovation. I doubt whether those in the audience really knew what they were applauding for, and if in their short visits to Jerusalem they saw more than just the lobby of the King David Hotel.

The jobless rate was 6.6 percent in March, up from 6.5 percent in February, the U.S. Department of Labor estimated Friday.

An improving economic situation typically brings out more job seekers, as people who had been discouraged by earlier difficulties get back in the hunt.

Howard added that he was unsure of Artie's future with the show ("I haven't spoken with Artie. Robin has. Tim has...I'm just freaked out. I don't know what to do.

There are few rules of engagement in political campaigning. Truth, or more accurately the full truth, is the first casualty of campaigning. Misstatements and omissions are carefully crafted by high-priced communication experts and strategists to deliver the message. The universal rule of engagement is to not attack the candidate's family. Candidates use their families to show they are real people. Loving families help deflect the harshness of the attacks on the candidate. They are valuable props.

Sadly, with Morgan, Danielle and Tania ending up at the bottom, it's Tania, a girl with cute bangs and a cool forearm tattoo, who is told to "pack your tools and go." I honestly saw the most potential in her out of the three. (GP says: Mathew is biased in favor of tattoos.) After the elimination, Danielle thanks her lucky stars, Tania cries, and Morgan pouts. That about wraps it up. I'm quite sure we're in for a season full of drama, sabotage, tears, meltdowns and disrespect!

Instead, he eased into some thoughts about the issue of influence on writers and whether that is good or bad. When you like a book, it's telling you something about your own character and style, he mused.

Wills rightly feels that he has been lucky, but he has also made some of that good fortune through his determination to seize opportunities. He does not wear his erudition lightly. Or even his reading, perhaps because he grew up in such an unbookish family. When he was in grade school, his father offered him $5 if he read nothing for a week. It is typical of Wills that he took the bet, won it, and then spent the money on a new book!

Luck is considered the most NFL-ready quarterback since Peyton Manning left Tennessee in 1998 for the Colts. Oddly, he will wind up as Manning's replacement in Indy after the four-time MVP was released by the Colts and signed with Denver. Rarely do college quarterbacks call their own plays or have total freedom behind center. Luck did.

It is time for a little history lesson. In 1775 King George III so vehemently opposed the colonists having any say in who should act on their behalf that he hired Hessian troops to kill their nascent desire to have a modicum of representation in Parliament. The result was a revolution that cost King George the most valuable part of the British Empire.

Hey, Dan: More than ever, I'm of the opinion the Browns need a bigger, stronger quarterback to compete in their brutal division. Yes, everyone scoffs at Derek Anderson, with good reason. But the fact is they won 10 games when he was flinging the ball to Braylon Edwards and Kellen Winslow. No, I don't want Anderson back. But the Browns need to think big at the quarterback position. The key, of course, is to find a bigger quarterback with a strong arm and many of the same intangibles as McCoy.

Still, as the Associated Press points out, the Thunder's 14-2 mark in March is the best record for a month in "franchise history."

As to his contention that the "childfree movement" is disorganized and uncertain about policy, there would be an element of truth to that, if I believed there were a cohesive "childfree movement" to speak of. The childfree aren't monolithic in their beliefs. There are hard left, hard right, moderate and politically apathetic childfree people. In terms of religious beliefs, they're across the board. The one (and only) thing they have in common is never having been, and never wanting to become, a parent. The time may come when childfree PACs form, but it hasn't happened yet. There is no "Million Childfree March" penciled in on my calendar yet, either.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the plan entails too much government.
The Olympic qualification process for soccer is awkward, at best. The U.S. team was put together solely for this tournament. The team it would have sent to London, had it qualified, would have looked much different. The United States and other national teams aren't playing with their best players, many of whom are tied to their European clubs at the moment. The Olympic teams can add three over-age players, and presumably other age-eligible players currently employed professionally. So the likes of Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan weren't on the pitch against El Salvador, which really shouldn't have mattered.

State eyes Multnomah County’s governor vote: The race for guv remains too close to call. But it seems to be trending for Kitzhaber. The Oregonian’s political team has been crunching the numbers. Multnomah County, a sea of blue, is the key. Jeff Mapes summarized the numbers late last night. Here’s my back of the envelope look this morning. Dudley leads by 15,411 votes right now, according to Oregonlive. Multnomah County had counted 215,071 ballots as of about 8 a.m. The county reported receiving 280,101 ballots. A few of those will be tossed because they lack signatures. That leaves, say, 278,000 ballots total and roughly 62,929 ballots yet to be counted. Kitzhaber is collecting about 69 percent of all Multnomah County votes and Dudley 28 percent. If things continue at that rate, Kitzhaber would pass Dudley and lead him by about 11,000 votes. There are votes yet to count from other counties, but Dudley would probably have to score huge, huge victories in those counties to pull it out. But that’s just some quick math. Follow Jeff Mapes and Oregonlive for the latest updates today. I’m biased, but we’ve got the best staff in the state pulling data from all corners of the state. Here's the latest from The Oregonian.

"But even if the chaplains interviewed had perfect information about the relative distribution of religious groups among inmates in the prisons where they work, the findings would not be weighted in proportion to the size of the overall U.S. prison population. As a result, they would not provide an accurate count of religious affiliation in the U.S. prison population."
Kitzhaber has repeatedly said he won't support the logging bill, but he is willing to look at another Republican proposal to draw more water from the Columbia River. The most current version of that bill would eventually generate an estimated 1,400 jobs on farms and in food processing plants. Supporters say that would make a huge difference in the state's struggling rural counties.

He was listed on the depth chart as a backup SAM linebacker.
Foothill coach Vince Namba was an assistant at Foothill when Mann was playing from 1999-2001. Namba said Marinacci and Mann share the same ball-handling skills, which make them hard to guard for players their size. They can post up small guards and they can take large post players off the dribble.

At times, the story seems to have lost its way, but virtually all of the aforementioned elements come together in the final act, with sometimes stunning finality. The cast is uniformly excellent, but this is Dafoe's showcase.

Practice restraint. One really fabulous work of art, well placed, has more impact than lots of smaller pieces. And it might be all the art your garden needs. Buy what you love, not what someone tells you to buy because it's "art." You're going to have a piece of art, especially a statement piece, for a long time. If you can't afford to make the purchase now, put in a plant to serve as focal point and placeholder, knowing that when you can afford the piece you want, you'll sacrifice the plant for the art.
A breakneck French thriller, Point Blank is so ridiculously successful at keeping its momentum going - and keeping the audience tense with suspense - that it's likely to leave you with your heart pounding, gasping for breath.

Jason Segel plays the titular character, pot-smoking, 30-year-old slacker who still lives in the basement of his childhood home. (A side note: New Orleans natives Jay and Mark Duplass moved back into their parents' house with their own families while shooting on location.) But Jeff is a thinker and a dreamer. Inspired by the M. Night Shyamalan movie "Signs," he believes there are no coincidences, that everything happens for a reason if you're willing to open your mind and pay attention to the daily details that can determine your fate.
By my count, Oregon's tech recovery began last December and picked up steam during the summer -- annual job growth was 6.8 percent in each of the past two months.

The anger of the exiles in Miami is understandable, but it cannot hide the failure of the Cuba embargo. Not only has it not weakened the Castro regime, but it has provided it with a neat self-justification, portraying Cuba as the victim of U.S. hostility, elevating Fidel's status within Latin America and embittering Washington's relations with Latin America and the Caribbean.

William F. Reed, SI.com: "Most of the credit -- or blame -- for our collective madness belongs to Adolph Rupp, who won 876 games and four NCAA titles at UK from 1930-'72. More than Henry Iba or Joe Lapchick or any other coach from the 1940s and '50s, Rupp invented overemphasis in college hoops, and his legacy to UK fans is the superiority complex they display to this day, much to the consternation of U of L fans and many others in college hoops. The first five of Rupp's successors -- Joe B. Hall, Eddie Sutton, Pitino, Tubby Smith and Billy Gillespie -- all tried to tame the beast in one way or another. But John Calipari is different. He feeds the flames and fans them, talking about something mystical he calls ‘The Kentucky Effect,' which embodies everything to do with the lust for winning that makes UK the perfect place for a coach who likes to demagogue it up a bit. Calipari and UK were made for each other. Calipari freely admits that he's running an NBA prep school for one-and-done superstars. This is just fine with those in Big Blue Nation, who have long regarded academics as mostly a nuisance.

It's important, of course, that we prioritize our concerns. The real issue is the murder of Bradley-Crockett, mother of three, and the desecration of her corpse. There's a killer out there who decided that this woman deserved no better than a concrete burial. It's important to keep Bradley-Crockett's death and the pursuit of her justice as the priority.

With Matt Forte out two to six weeks with a sprained MCL, Marion Barber (76 carries, 281 yards, five TDs) will start and Kahlil Bell (15, 57, 0) will fill Barber's reserve role.

That was meant to be funny, of course, the juvenile cut-ups of a frat house that refuses to take responsibilities seriously. But less amusing are the antics of conservatives who decided to conduct their own futile and stupid gesture this week in the form of the "cut, cap and balance" proposal that would take $100 billion from this year's budget, cap future budgets to a percentage of the country's economic activity and require a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

The SRT8-only steering wheel has a flat bottom and paddle shifters. Sport mode does a great job of controlling the transmission automatically, so I didn't feel the paddle shifters were necessary. There's no rev-matching function to smooth out downshifting, so downshifts are harsh, making the paddle shifters even less enticing.

Twice the Rockies have had a chance to win a deciding game. Both times, their defense betrayed them. Jordan Pacheco threw wildly in Houston on Sunday as a 2-1 lead fizzled into a 3-2 loss.

With their flat terrain and tabula-rasa potential, the two parks, occupying the old site of the Rand Corp. headquarters just west of Santa Monica City Hall, offer little of the romantic, post-industrial drama of the sites where Field Operations has produced its most memorable designs. There is no rusting and useful relic like the abandoned elevated train tracks that form the spine of Corner's most celebrated work, the High Line park on the far west side of Manhattan. There is nothing like the complex history of the Fresh Kills waterfront park on New York's Staten Island, a former landfill that is nearly three times the size of Central Park and became a macabre sorting ground for World Trade Center rubble after the 9/11 attacks.

Extensive scar tissue from Shamabhat’s three previous surgeries will make it difficult for Lytle to see her heart. The limited view increases the chances that he’ll nick an artery or vein.

Is there something in the water these days? Two other new plays embrace this neurotic preoccupation, as well.

Imagine the nails gnawed and the edges of seats worn out during the final 15 minutes. Eli Manning had his seventh fourth-quarter comeback in line when he took advantage of a short field — Kyle Williams’ first gaffe — and threaded a 17-yard touchdown to Mario Manningham.

The “TRON: Legacy” soundtrack proves an enjoyable exercise in electro-classical fusion: Most of the songs are brief, string-heavy and ominous, and draw more heavily from Howard Shore’s moody soundtracks for the “Lord of the Rings” franchise than they do from the original “Tron” score. A few tracks do sport the unmistakable Daft Punk signature of flat synth bass and wild, digitally manipulated arpeggios over the top. “Derezzed,” “The Grid” and a few others threaten to take to the dance floor. That they never quite get there is a testament to the party-happy band’s restraint.
When: 10:30 a.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays; first-come, first-served (see the schedule at the information desk on Main Level 2)
When fashion-conscious Vanessa Getty calls, her girlfriends listen. Dozens of San Francisco's better-dressed women came to a trunk show at her brother-in-law's stylish 19th century Italianate Victorian in Pacific Heights to shop the fall 2010 Ralph Lauren collection, with many runway looks not previously available on the West Coast, along with Lauren's new lingerie line, which recently was introduced at his flagship store at 888 Madison Ave. in New York. The event doubled as a fundraiser, with a portion of sales proceeds going to the Peninsula Humane Society, a pet cause of Getty, who has four rescue cats. The Victorian house, once a bed and breakfast inn, is now home to Peter Getty.
Daley, in our interview, also for the first time reacted to assertions by Senate Democrats in the new book by journalist David Corn, Showdown, that he was free-lancing in his dealings with GOP House Speaker John Boehner during the 2011 fiscal battles. "I wasn't ceding anything that wasn't authorized by the entire White House," Daley said.
“Coming off this win, I believe the girls will keep the momentum going and continue to work hard and the hard work will show on the scoreboard,” said Burrini, who has had to do far more than just coach this season. Her youthful enthusiasm and positive attitude has been therapy for a team that has taken more than its share of body blows this season. After being outscored 49-21 in their first three losses, Burrini saw a need to lift the team’s dwindling spirits.
It’s often a challenge to stand alone in the face of injustice, and question authority and the status quo. But for some, the difficulty may be eased — if only a little — by an example set by a boy, who was born a girl, and who isn’t afraid to express his beliefs.
This seemed like a splendid idea to us and we were very curious. When we told our fathers of our plans they raised no objections. I guess they recalled their own boyhood days and considered going to a burlesque show a rite of passage.
New York City teachers will have to resist hitting the "Add Friend" button on their students' Facebook pages.
At the headquarters, in Cupertino, Calif., mourners placed flowers and a few pieces of Jobs memorabilia under the sign for the company's signature address, 1 Infinite Loop. By Wednesday evening the shrine had attracted a small crowd of visitors and Apple employees.

Ernestine Walker married her childhood sweetheart, Willie Hill, who had followed her here. In the 1950s, they were among the first residents of the Pruitt-Igoe housing complex, an experiment in subsidized housing that was later razed.
Why is that embarrassing? Consider the example of the Toronto Raptors. During their blowout loss to Orlando on Monday, Magic players were confused when the crowd cheered loudly for a mopup-time basket by the Raptors' Ed Davis, the Orlando Sentinel's Josh Robbins reports.
Mitch Fatel blends funny with confused, innocence with inappropriate. The veteran of Letterman, Leno and Comedy Central is one of the most requested comedians on Sirius and XM satellite radio. His new special, "Mitch Fatel is Magical," will be on Comedy Central in September.
Grunwald, played by Raye Birk, espouses well-made drama in the style of Ibsen, Shaw and Chekhov, playwrights whose portraits adorn the walls of his office. Anything more modern is disdained as "experimental," including Stanislavski, whom he dismisses as "a Russian Jew who made a fortune off of insecure actors." Opinionated, manipulative and self-absorbed, this character could easily come off as repellent were it not for the engaging energy and insight Birk brings to the role. He subtly reveals the disappointments that underlie Grunwald's bravado and tempers his egotism with charm and self-deprecating humor. It's a wonderfully assured and modulated performance.
Here's how Annie Sloan updated a plain white cupboard with colors inspired by 18th-century Venice.
Both Leopold and Police Chief Col. James E. Teare, Sr. have declined to comment.

The ultimate winner will sit on a court that will tackle profound issues including whether pension benefits can be changed for public employees and what corporations can and can't do in this state.
(On the two defensive linemen free agent signings in Frostee Rucker and Juqua Parker)- "I think both of these guys are really going to help us. I think they are really good players. They are super, super tough. I know J.P. from my days in Philly and he is one of the greatest guys, greatest workers, team guy, tough and he can rush the passer. He was hurt a little bit last year so he didn't have as many numbers but he can rush the passer and he will help our football team. He really will. I think he will be great for our young defensive guys. With Frostee, I think it's the same thing. He played a lot of snaps for Cincinnati and we are going to use him inside as a pass rusher on third down, which he didn't do a whole lot there for whatever reason. They had other guys. We do think he is going to help us. We are excited about both those guys."

Randazzo wanted their help in getting his company on the list of businesses that provide financial services to public employees. He is the majority owner of the Twinsburg-based money management firm, which helps county employees invest their deferred compensation.

His comments, as well as others who inject religion into the political debate, bothered me just as they always have. Repeatedly, I've railed against those individuals and groups who would claim God as theirs exclusively, put the Creator in a box and then damn everyone who does not believe what they proclaim as "the way."
That explanation doesn't pass the smell test to some party leaders, however.

Well, not quite. There was nothing despicable about Clinton's ad, which simply implied that her superior experience in affairs of state made her the best person to handle a crisis. As the incumbent, Obama enjoys the same advantage over Romney, so it's little surprise that his campaign is making a big deal over his wise management of the Bin Laden operation. What makes the ad more than a little distasteful is its characterization of Romney's past statements, which are taken out of context to make it look as if he wouldn't have bothered pursuing the Al Qaeda mastermind.
"A year ago, airfares were actually cheap in summer and then went up after August," Koehler said. "This year, it's just the opposite."

The archdiocese says it merely wanted St. Stanislaus to have the same structure as other parishes and that there wasn't a plan to close the church. Plaintiffs allege in the lawsuit that cutting out the archbishop's authority meant St. Stanislaus was no longer Roman Catholic and violated the original bylaws.

An independent investigation of Sacramento County's Child Protective Services that is critical of the agency's leadership and handling of children's cases has been made public in advance of Tuesday's Board of Supervisors meeting.
But with a little sleuthing, you can find good and quick choices. In fact, McDonald's now sells more apples and walnuts than anyone. Still, at Mickey D's, like many places, you gotta sweat the small stuff. Like salad dressings. A Caesar salad with grilled chicken has a nifty 190 calories and 5 grams of fat. But add Creamy Caesar dressing and, boom, you're at 380 calories and 23 g of fat. Opt for Low-Fat Balsamic Vinaigrette, though, and you're at 225 calories, 7.5 g of fat (less than 3 of it saturated), and little sugar. Impressive. It actually meets the tough criteria of Cleveland Clinic's GO! Foods program.
The incident involved at least 23 federal security personnel: a dozen members of the Secret Service and 11 from the military. All were part of an advance team that traveled to Colombia ahead of President Obama's visit. They allegedly brought as many as 21 prostitutes to a hotel in Cartagena.

What keeps me going: “Hearing feedback from patients and their families that I helped make a difference in their lives.

Collecting and storing the things necessary for 72 hours without major services is a tall order. According to Joanna Gonzalez of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the priorities should be basic food and enough water, flashlight, first-aid kit, and a battery operated or solar powered radio. Additional items can be collected over time, rather than all at once.

So, yes, Aldridge had 39 points, and for stretches carried the Blazers in the fourth, including giving them their first lead after trailing by as many as 11 in the second half. And he really should have had the play of the game, a clean block of Kevin Durant with 6 seconds left that was inexplicably ruled a goaltend by referee Scott Foster.
Harris, a 6-foot-2, 185-pound combo guard, graduated from Southern in 2011 with no Division I scholarship offers. But a standout post-grad season with Massanutten Military Academy in Virginia earned him several DI offers, including one from Duquesne, which he accepted May 18.

“It's important for us to have fire and police,” Valenti said. “It's important that we have good equipment for fire and police.”
He has been quiet in the last few games, probably for a variety of reasons. Part of it is he hasn't had as many opportunities to make plays as he has in some games. Ball carriers and passes haven't been coming into his territory as much. And part of it may be that he's a little worn down or beat up. I don't know that for a fact, but I'm simply raising it as a possibility. We often don't know how players are feeling, or if they are fighting nagging injuries.
Schweich also tapped a couple of Republicans who lost contests seeking higher office last fall. Former Greene County prosecutor Darrell Moore will be Schweich's chief litigation counsel; and state Senate candidate Harry Otto, a CPA, will be the deputy auditor.

A recent report by ProPublica and the Columbia Journalism Review identified a host of ways in which the administration is making it harder for the public to access records heretofore more readily within reach. The Department of Energy wants to eliminate a rule that allowed it to release documents if it concluded that they would serve the public interest. The Department of Education has expanded its authority to refuse release of materials even after they are redacted to remove students' names and identifying information. Other agencies are raising fees for processing and copying. The Securities and Exchange Commission wants to charge $70 an hour for processing some requests -- not that anyone would want to study the efficacy of regulation and enforcement in the stock market.

A year before he took over the Cedar Lee, Forman rented it for a time to launch another movie enterprise he had little knowledge of running or sustaining. He called it the Cleveland International Film Festival. It showed eight films for a few thousand people.

Michelle Williams won best actress as Marilyn Monroe in the filmmaking tale "My Week with Marilyn."
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The NCAA Tournament, much as Reggie Jackson once did, gets a whole month of the calendar devoted to it. This year's installment had enough illogical upsets, enough brackets in flames, to satisfy all the March hares and still play host to a mad hatters convention.
Holman resigned from her court job in 2010 while being investigated for allegedly recalling a failure-to-appear warrant for one friend and falsely entering a disposition in the case of another. She was found guilty of the former and acquitted of the latter at her bench trial Tuesday before Circuit Judge Michael Stelzer.
Two words of warning, though, to any prospective employer. The first is that the doubts, introspection and self-analysis will likely follow Guardiola wherever he goes. Anyone who hires him will have to take the whole package: a man who questions everything he does, why he's doing it and whether he wouldn't be happier doing something else—and one who is honest enough not to commit long-term, because he knows himself well enough to know that when he stops enjoying himself and reaches his threshold, he'll walk away.
Hey, what’s not to love about 3-1 start on the road? A team will take that any time. And to be sure, there was plenty to like about the way the Dodgers opened the season in San Diego. Which is not the same as liking it all.
Dear Carolyn: My nephew, 7, is unquestionably spoiled. I think he's taking after my sister.
Service at Dosa has always been helpful, but somewhat forgetful. Staff members know the menu and can help inexperienced diners make their way through the selections, but at times they can become distracted. On one visit, for example, we never received a dish we had ordered, and on another we chose a Gruner Veltliner from the well-crafted wine list, but we had to remind the waiter about it after we had eaten several appetizers.
The district's market share will drop closer to 60 percent next year. It's conceivable, with the growth of alternatives accelerating, that the district could serve fewer than half the children who live within its boundaries in a few years.

RN: If you told me that Ms. Lewis also moonlights as an open-heart surgeon, I would believe you. She once nipped-and-tucked a beloved jacket of mine until it fit like the proverbial glove. Why don't we -- and by "we," I mean the vast majority of our gender -- avail ourselves of the valuable services of a tailor more often? Is it sheer laziness?
Councilman Darrin Sharif helped assemble the commission, saying the council needed an independent budget analysis. The group of roughly ten community and business leaders includes O’Flaherty — a former aide to Mayor Kenneth Gibson — business consultant Thomas Banker, and Robert Curvin, a senior policy fellow at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. The team assessed city budgets from 1996 on, and conducted numerous interviews with city officials.
This year's summer movie season - which kicks off May 4 with the superhero team-up film "The Avengers" and continues with 16 more "event" films through August - is the industry's most expensive ever. Five of the top titles cost more than $200 million each, a once-unthinkable ceiling that's being broken with increasing regularity.
What is one of the most important issues facing your generation? The lack of interpersonal skills. I feel that because of social-media sites, my generation does not know how to function without a digital interface.

Gretchen reveals these pants are the first ones she's made without somebody helping her. Eeek. That's usually not a good thing in "Project Runway" land. April sniffs that Gretchen is talented, but not creative. Casanova tells Tim that his design is something like a sailor outfit. ???? Gretchen notices the cutaway back on Nicholas' blouse design looks a lot like the back of the dress she won the first challenge with. He ripped me off, she says.
At UC Berkeley, Bauer majored in peace and conflict studies with a minor in Arabic, and traveled to Sudan's war-torn Darfur region at one point to research a thesis.

Paul Miller, an analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., said the strategy is essential to stabilizing the banks. He said forcing companies to carry more common equity would improve market confidence.
Because he must restrict fats and cream, old standbys for a chef, it has forced him to become even more creative in the kitchen. "I cook with lemon or a fruit juice broth -- to marinate or add at the end," he says. "It really changes up the flavors. And I don't cheat myself out of flavor."

How about good, fundamental hitting from a team that lacks power and plays in a venue with a vast outfield that should allow space for base hits. But you can't hit the ball if you don't hit it. Going into the series finale with Philly, Padres batters had struck out 132 times.

Many U.S. businesses, especially large ones, are faring well. Big companies hold an estimated $2 billion in cash. Because of doubts over the economy, they've been reluctant to invest in new workers. Instead, companies have sat on the cash or returned some of it to stockholders through dividends or share buybacks.
It is the second tax increase the school board has referred to the May ballot. The first was a record-setting $548 million school construction bond that, if approved, will cost property owners $2 for every $1,000 of assessed property values for the next six years.
Last night: Maria and Derek got the first perfect score of the season. Tonight: the "final" dance duel. Isn't it a bit weird to call it final when it only ended up happening twice total?
Romney has spent the last couple of days courting moderate voters in Ohio, whose electoral votes are indispensible to any realistic prospect for his election, and Democratic-leaning Michigan, which Republicans hope to put back into play by November. It's an overdue pivot for a candidate who spent most of the primary season genuflecting to the GOP's anti-government extremists.

Now some Democratic lawmakers actually want to make more trouble for struggling local governments trying to regain their financial footing. Assemblyman Bob Wieckowski, D-Fremont, has introduced a bill that would make it even more difficult for local governments to file for bankruptcy, which would allow them to seek compensation concessions from public employee unions. These governments already in some circumstances have to go through a "neutral evaluation" before a bankruptcy declaration. The new bill would give the mediator in the process even more ability to delay or thwart the plans of cities in terrible financial straits.

Another cause for Democratic optimism is the welcome improvement in the economy. Still, it remains in dire straits. Some 13 million Americans are unemployed, with millions more working only part-time or having given up on finding a job. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke says he doesn't see "further substantial declines" in the unemployment rate this year, meaning a jobless rate of around 8 percent Election Day.

While no one would doubt Payne's stewardship — his previous three films, "Sideways," "About Schmidt" and "Election," were nominated for a combined eight Academy Awards and won one Oscar — Clooney said King was not precisely in his wheelhouse, which ultimately was part of its attraction. It's hard to make Clooney look bad, but King bears scant resemblance to the polished-to-perfection Danny Ocean in "Ocean's Eleven" or Ryan Bingham in "Up in the Air." As Clooney himself describes King, he's a schlub, and there's not much to look at on the inside, either.

He switched focus after a student gig assisting artist Matthew Barney in New York. If it hadn't been for that, Mercier would probably be designing rather fabulous car doors, he said. With Barney, Mercier said, "I discovered that ambition in man wasn't necessarily something disgusting, linked to power and money, but that ambition could simply be a magnificent energy, the energy of an artist, in fact, to create. To make."

My first exposure to Austen tourism was on a visit to Bath, the lovely but tourist-filled spa town with its famous Regency-era crescent. Austen visited the Lower Assembly Rooms and the town's famed Pump Room, both of which look much as they did in Austen's time. My wife sought out the house on Sydney Place where Austen lived. When she stood in the doorway, it was as if I were witnessing the literary equivalent of a pilgrimage to Lourdes. Austen herself had mixed feelings about Bath, which taught her much about the class-based manners and backbiting that would be laced throughout her books. Both "Northanger Abbey" and "Persuasion" are set primarily in and around Bath. Neighborhoods just a few hundred yards apart had widely different social standing. Austen once wrote a relative of the social claustrophobia, lamenting, "I hate tiny parties; they force one into constant exertion," an idea echoed by Anne Elliott in "Persuasion," who complains of returning to Bath for the social season, "with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment of many months." Whatever Austen thought of Bath, Bath loves Austen. There is a Jane Austen Centre chronicling her life on Gay Street. The death of her father in 1805 had Austen on the move again.

I wanted to do this one in an intimate way, because I think the concept is intimate. They know about my life and the ELP years and all of this.

During those years, per-pupil spending rose by as much as 20 percent in some of the neediest school districts. At the same time, the hold-harmless districts benefited from the plan's extras, adding an average of $580 in new money per pupil under the plan, according to a legislative report.

The northeast corner of the living room is essentially a wall of windows. (For sustainability reasons, only the lower windows are operable, but that's enough to create plenty of cross-ventilation to keep the house cool in all but the hottest weather, said Kevin.)

Judged by the headlines per capita generated, you'd have to go with the Boston Red Sox. We all know what Stephen King's next book will be: "Full Dark, No Stars -- at Fenway." But from a baseball view, I think the Braves plummet has been far more surprising and damning for that organization. We all know the big number. A month ago, the Braves had a 10 1/2-game lead in the wild card and they were widely considered the second-base team in the National League, ahead of the Milwaukee Brewers and whoever the NL West had to offer. Atlanta was a worthy challenger to the league's Goliath, the Philadelphia Phillies. My, how things have changed. The Braves' pitching has ruptured, their brilliant young relievers have faded with fatigue and overuse, and the offense has vanished. The Red Sox lost their lead to the Tampa Bay Rays, a team good enough to win either of the other AL divisions and contend for three of the playoff berths available in the NL. Atlanta hasn't had that quality of opponent on their heels, and still they've faltered, letting losing teams defy them and the Cardinals nearly catch them.

Second, the U.S. credit crisis has made it harder for the Big Three to arrange car loans for their customers and to obtain credit to fund their own operations.

Whedon gets the big stuff right, too, from the conversion of an aircraft carrier to the enormous SHIELD flying fortress to the final battle, which originally feels like it's just going to be a coherent Michael Bay moment but winds up delivering the adrenaline while also driving the story and the characters.

Andrew Breitbart — my dear wild friend, who died yesterday at the heartbreakingly young age of 43 — could have become a mainstream media mogul, perhaps the first true mogul of the Internet era.
The answer: Hiring is one of the biggest challenges a manager faces. People definitely put their best foot forward in interviews. Therefore you have to rely on a variety of other factors, including situational responses. I favor the non-traditionalist or the creative one.

It is unclear how the judges and magistrates in Cuyahoga County's juvenile court handle emergency hearings because they did not provide an interview. Rubin said the county's juvenile court system had once participated in the national council's model court program, which establishes guidelines for handling cases.

I did try to watch Sullinger after the game Saturday as the Wisconsin fans mobbed the floor, but I wasn't courtside and obviously it's impossible to tell what's going on from up in the seats.

The investment group said Cigna relies too much on "adjusted income from operations," which exceeded its targeted performance because customers didn't seek medical services, not because of an executive's performance.

A: You are finding it difficult to kill the mushrooms because they are only a small part of the fungus that is eating your dead stump. The rest of the fungus consists of thread-like filaments that grow between and into dead cells throughout the wood. It will continue to produce flushes of mushrooms until it runs out of wood for food. I don't have a good chemical solution to this problem, so I suggest you look at it from an integrated-pest-management perspective and consider another type of control.

After I slipped on my headphones and began the audio guide, I learned that García Márquez's stay was relatively brief; he arrived in 1948 and remained only a year (he eventually returned and buit a home here in the 1990s).

Schumaker lasted only two pitches into the Cardinals' 4-1 win. He later admitted to jarring the same area (right oblique) that forced him to the disabled list after suffering a strain during a March 16 exhibition against the Miami Marlins. However, he insisted that the hit wasn't debilitating and that he anticipated being available Saturday. Jay made the same claim and, according to manager Mike Matheny, could have pinch ran Friday. Having at least one of them available is vital within a series that projects to be low-scoring and subject to extra innings.

Cashman has been the Yankees' GM for 15 years. He knows what awaits him.
In the long run, he's financially secure to put it mildly, and rather than gimp around for another year, he made the ultimate team move and will be thankful for his decision as he gets older and is be able to take walks with his kids.

What's driving this insiders' insurrection? Perhaps a sense that a libertarian-leaning belief in fully extending the freedom to marry to all Americans does not, in fact, clash with a conservative commitment to holding together the social fabric, as marriage entails personal responsibility and social stability. Or perhaps these GOP leaders are beginning to see an alignment of their rhetoric about individual liberty with public opinion; in the last month, two national polls, by CNN and The Associated Press, showed that a majority of Americans nationwide now support marriage for gay and lesbian couples.
Nadal saved seven of eight break points in the first set, including five which were set points for Ferrer in the 12th game. He fired an ace to save the last before holding for the tiebreaker, and Ferrer's double fault allowed Nadal to get ahead 4-1 as he took the first set in a grueling 93 minutes.

If you have an indie rock band and your name isn’t already “Cobra Triangle,” consider this a freebie. This game was the first NES game we remember that was simply impossible. The levels seem to go on forever and get progressively more insane, which is saying something given the game’s boxart. One of the first isometric shooters, this game was something that only could’ve existed in the late 80s. Speedboats were all the rage back then. You never really hear about speedboats anymore, do you?

The dunes, gold-pink in the late afternoon sun, curved and undulated to the western horizon like the hips and shoulders of beautiful women.
Two days before, Houston attended a pre-Grammy party for singer Kelly Price at a club in Hollywood called Tru.

We all know that the cost of higher education continues to increase at an exponential rate. The problem is real and, not to sound apocalyptic, getting worse. Recently, as has already been reported, the state legislature failed to approve its proposed budget and ended up with a "doomsday" budget that shortchanges the University of Maryland College Park and many other institutions and government programs. Specifically, the doomsday measure includes a potential 10 percent (or greater) tuition increase.

State Transportation Commissioner Jim Simpson said redirecting the money from the canceled tunnel project to a capital plan that maintains roads and bridges is a better use of Turnpike Authority money for New Jersey residents.
Strahan gets paid to make controversial statements, and such talk always has come naturally to Owens. What the two are expressing, however, is a widely held belief that it's only a matter of time before Cutler makes a dumb throw that will cost his team.

In it is a measure that would give the NHTSA's alcohol-detector program $24 million over two years—a sum that could allow the agency by 2013 to equip a fleet of 100 or more cars with prototypes of two types of alcohol detectors. One would measure the alcohol in the driver's breath. The other would use touch technology to take a reading from the driver's skin, likely the fingertip used to activate a starter button.

Although it took nine years, the couple engaged Mike Hughes of Kirkwood, owner of Crem Inc., design and building, to create Jerry's library. By then, Jerry had amassed so many books they were stacked 5 feet high in his office. Mike had redone the basement, family room and entryway of the 3,800-square foot home. But this time he measured Jerry's books and calculated that 200 linear feet of shelving would house them in a 16-by-14 room. "We blew out the ceiling and the back wall, built a new roof and an 11-foot coffered ceiling," he says. He paneled the walls and ceiling in poplar and maple and hand-applied five coats of finishes over time until he reached the desired rich effect. Caryl cites the quality of Mike's work and adds, "He has a good eye for scale."

Shumpert watched from the locker room. ... It's the first time the Heat have held a 2-0 series lead over the Knicks. All four previous matchups were split after the opening two games.
Obviously that pace is going to slow down; I would be surprised if, in the end, this team eclipses last year's total of 162 homers. But it now appears that they can match last year's runs-scored total of 762; they're currently on pace to score 909. The lineup's performance so far has allayed some of the concerns I had about the offense entering the year.

In eight passages contained in those documents, New Jersey initiatives and ALEC proposals line up almost word for word. Two other Republican bills not pushed by the governor’s office are nearly identical to ALEC models.

If you don't have the time or inclination for a whole meal, just make these tidbits and serve along with a bottle of bubbly, and finish with deep, dark chocolate for dessert. You don't have to cut these into hearts, and I promise not to require it in any of the other recipes, but it's just too good an opportunity to pass up. If you're not the heart-cutting type, omit this step.
WASHINGTON -- Six-term Indiana Sen.

And when he supported the 1981 bill, he argued that the government should not bear the expense of incarcerating the most heinous criminals when they deserve to die.

He bundled his dreadlocks together, tied them in a bun, then a moment later, he released them. Then repeated the process.

Over the last decade, ViaCyte has learned how to make what it calls pro-islet cells: ones that are on the way to becoming islet cells but haven't fully matured. The company started with stem cells from blastocysts — very early stage embryos — that were destined for destruction at a fertility clinic. It then used natural growth factors to encourage the cells to turn into pancreatic cells. Once under a mouse's skin, the cells mature into beta islet cells. After a couple of months, they start making insulin.

Finally, they get to the point where they say, 'This animal has to be dealt with.' You wouldn't believe how many people sit outside with a pitchfork or a shovel and wait for the ground to move so they can flip them out and beat them to death."

The Asparagus Roll ($5.25) pairs the spring vegetable with crab salad with a sprinkling of sesame seeds. The soothing dairy presence is there, but not in the usual fatty, gluey way of the more ubiquitous cream cheese. Every ingredient is showcased. Shinano's homemade sauces are a true strength. The gingery salad dressings, rich broths in soup and sukiyaki ($16.95) all had complex flavors, making the place stand out. That was especially true for the tart ponzu dipping sauce with the sliced, expertly grilled Steak Shinano ($16.75) and the creamy, gingery dip with the Shrimp Shinano. -- Debbi Snook

-� 2007 Kumeu River Sauvignon Blanc, Kumeu, New Zealand ($19-$23) - I picked up this wine a couple of months ago and today noticed that it is a 2007. That would be on the older side for a lot of Sauvignon Blancs but this winery makes excellent wine and I had high hopes. When I opened it, there were qualities of an aged wine but it was still very, very nice. The color has some deeper ring-gold tone to it, while still being light. The aroma has caramelized grapefruit and corn husk. The taste has a chalky/stony quality with roundness from the aging and a little smoke in the finish. 89 points

Yet the decisions in both cases here were made by people closest to the situation, not by an impartial third-party panel. That's how it should be. But the principle stands: Sometimes, based primarily on a person's age, administering certain medical treatment and/or tests is just ridiculous.
Boundaries aren’t such a bad thing; they keep the cows from roaming the freeways. Should the urge strike to let one’s lips prowl the neck of another woman’s husband, true friendship and empathy make the best fences. A true friend might find herself attracted to your husband but would be careful to avoid saying or doing anything to tempt him or make you feel threatened. This “friend’s” sneak attack on your husband’s neck meat, along with her notion of sexual fidelity -- “Till death do us part or the NBA shot clock runs down” -- suggests that she’s a narcissist, a self-absorbed, manipulative user.
Eric Hosmer is Kansas City's next sports star. You see that, right? If not, you soon will. There will be a time, probably not long from now, that Hosmer will have a case with Tamba Hali and Eric Berry and Bill Self and anybody else you might consider the biggest star in town.

The Landfall City Council's eventual decision -- a meeting Wednesday at 6 p.m. will address the proposal -- could have consequences for its fire protection, too. Maplewood, a Ramsey County city neighboring Landfall, also holds that contract. City Administrator Jim Antonen said if Landfall doesn't want Maplewood police it might make sense to reconsider the fire department contract.
"It was month after month after month," Smith said. "I'm not blaming anyone but myself, but to me they're taking advantage of people they know are going through hard times. The interest rates are just crazy."

"The content, tone and purpose of Boeheim's statements would clearly signal to the reasonable reader that what was being said in the articles published in the days after the initial ESPN report were likely to be an opinion _ a biased, passionate, and defensive point of view of a basketball coach _ rather than objective fact," DeJoseph wrote in his 30-page decision. "It is clear to this court that Boeheim provided a factual basis for his opinion. He provided a ... reasonably accurate version of those facts."
CDC officials acknowledged the limitations of their analysis. In surveillance areas where researchers had access only to health records, and not school records, prevalence estimates were generally lower.

Can any musical created in response to such a time still speak to us today when what was once so fresh, indeed subversive, has become the very thing it sought to subvert?

More intriguingly, SEIU is a huge supporter of the Occupy Wall Street movement, which, taken at its word, is most concerned with income inequality and the back-room corruption that comes from "crony capitalism." And Mr. Stern touts China as the model for how to fix things? China has 115 billionaires and at least 115 million people living on a dollar a day or less. Nearly all of those billionaires got rich gaming a corrupt political system.

The struggle to scrape together the $500 monthly rent from workers who barely earn enough to cover personal expenses proved nearly impossible, said center leader Fabian Galindo.

We had a good rain at the end of December, which is great but now your yard is full of weed seedlings. I have a tendency to let mine get bigger as I get a perverse sense of pleasure when pulling weeds by hand. However, if you are not averse to using chemicals, spray Roundup on your carpet of weed seedlings, following directions on the container. Some gardeners prefer to hoe weeds but there are mixed opinions on this practice. Many feel that this is unnecessary soil disturbance and that it in fact exposes even more seeds to sunlight for subsequent germination.
When Cafe Marimba in San Francisco's Marina district closed last year after a slow, painful demise, it was the end of a restaurant that at one time served the best Mexican food in the Bay Area, going far beyond the typical burrito and taco joints.

2. Don't mess with anything: In terms of your morning routine, treat race day as one of your long run days: same breakfast, same clothes, same rituals, same drinks, same gels. A new shirt will chaff like sandpaper. New shoes? Are you nuts? Don't change a thing. I know a guy who decided -- on race day -- to experiment with an energy drink as a pre-race pick-me-up. He ended up in the fetal position in the back of a cab.

2B JOE MORGAN: There are probably numbers and performances out there that make it possible to pick another player at second. I just didn't find them. Morgan won five Gold Gloves at the position, two MVPs, and was the engine behind the Big Red Machine. Yes, he's become a polarizing personality as a broadcaster, but should detract from his career anymore than Berra's charisma hides his. From 1975 to 1976, Morgan won his two MVPs with a batting li9ne of .324/.456/.541 and OPS of .997. Several of my friends have pointed out that some of the same measures that Morgan rails against on the air are the same that support his place as the greatest living second baseman. Other candidates: Roberto Alomar, Craig Biggio, Jeff Kent. Active candidates: Someday Chase Utley.

"The Finest Wines of Bordeaux" (UC Press, 320 pages, $34.95): The regional series from the World of Fine Wines magazine has its ups and downs, but James Lawther's take on the most historically influential wine region takes a remarkably fresh look at an area often treated with fustiness and boredom. Names both obvious and obscure receive colorful profiles, although the tasting notes are focused on more recent vintages.

There were four rappers in the Pharcyde, two of whom were pretty similar. Imani and Booty Brown both had high voices and liked to horse around, but their jabs could be deadly when they wanted them to be. I have listened to the Pharcyde's albums hundreds of times and I still can't tell them apart sometimes. Slimkid3 was the deep thinker in the bunch, and one who developed a half-sung, half-rapped delivery almost two decades before Drake. But the best of the bunch was Fatlip, a former solo artist who was the last in and the first out. Fatlip remains one of the true unsung storytellers in '90s hip-hop, and "Labcabincalifornia" was his showcase. He's first up to bat on "Runnin'," and as he did all over the album, he sets the agenda with the story of a kid (probably him) who's pushed around until he finally lashes back. Like De La Soul on "Peas Porridge," you can tell that he knows that it's a waste of time to fight, and that he hates being dragged down to the level of his adversaries, but he knows it's his dignity at stake. Like much of "Labcabincalifornia," "Runnin'" was produced by the late J. Dilla, and he matches the storytelling here with a beat that is, like these four emcees, so sweet that you might miss the toughness underneath.

Nine years ago, "American Wedding" opened with $33 million. But if the fourth theatrical movie ends up lagging its previous entries domestically, it may make up some ground internationally. Overseas, "Reunion" opened in 28 foreign countries and collected $19.3 million. According to Universal, that's 105% ahead of how much "Wedding" made in the same locations in 2003. The new movie performed especially well this weekend in Russia and Australia, selling about $5 million worth of tickets in each country.

At first I was a little taken aback. I asked why he wanted to keep buying bonds, and my dad said that while he understands his gifts could probably earn more by investing them another way, the bonds represent something meaningful between his grandson and him. My father and his wife are on a fixed income, so there's little chance that Gerald will receive an inheritance. Giving Gerald bonds as gifts is my dad's way of leaving my son an inheritance while he's still alive. "One day I won't be around," he told me. "But when he needs the money for college he'll have those bonds to cash in, and I hope when he does he'll think of me."
The scheme involving the doughnut shop became public for the first time earlier this month.

Boy and girl, instead of boy and boy, meet by chance on a train in Europe. They talk, get off the train in Vienna, fall in love and talk a lot more until dawn. Meandering and quietly enchanting, this early feature by Richard Linklater stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy (and Vienna, which looks a lot more inviting than it does in "The Third Man"). The couple meets again, nine years later, in "Before Sunset," which has some lively moments, but a great deal of slow walking and fatuous talking about love, sex and married life.
Detectives from New Providence Police Department processed the crime scene and interviewed potential witnesses as well as the victim of this attack.

The county property could hold a building with a 60,000-square-foot footprint, whether for more convention meeting rooms or a hotel, he said. The building could line up with the convention center below and link to the medical mart next door, perhaps via a raised bridge.
Travelers are muttering to themselves, said George Hobica, the founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, which prides itself on finding low fares. "We have a price-conscious audience," he said, "and we're getting a lot of grief." The question Airfarewatchdog faces is this: Does it wait until fares come down to post something for its readers ("It may never happen," he said), or does it post these higher fares? Which, of course, is our dilemma about buying and flying. Do we wait, or do we vacate the vacation? Or is there some other strategy?

He is Mr. Irreplaceable, but now the Yankees must find a substitute. The career of baseball's greatest closer will be on an extended pause after a record 608 saves, 76 wins, 18,847 pitches and a 2.21 ERA — the best since Walter Johnson retired in 1927.
I quickly found out. The Minuet modulates from the amateur-friendly key of C into punishing passages of seven sharps. It's been a while since music-theory class, but I think that's the key of Z. Hey, when I was studying this stuff in the '60s and '70s, Pluto was still a planet and, as I recall, only five of the known sharps and maybe four flats had yet been discovered.

In a speech to the conservative American Enterprise Institute three days before the Japan earthquake, Rowe said that "natural gas is queen" - and that doubling or tripling the size of the current nuclear fleet would require $300 billion to $600 billion in government subsidies, because the plants aren't economic at today's natural gas prices.
Since the statute of limitations for civil rights violations has long since expired, Gilbert said some of the discussion involved the basis for a federal case, assuming there's evidence to warrant moving forward. "We told Mr. Perez that we're not looking to put people in jail," Gilbert said. "We're looking for some answers and acknowledgment that this evidence is compelling. We're researching whether, within the Justice Department, there's some kind of fact-finding process that's designed to further justice, but not prosecute."
NEW YORK - A team of police officers and FBI agents began digging up a basement in New York City on Thursday as part of a decades-old investigation into the disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz, whose case made a generation of parents afraid to send their children out alone.

Even with the Predators dominating the third period and overtime, the Coyotes wouldn't let them score, getting big saves from goalie Mike Smith and shuttling the puck out of their zone when they got tired—which was a lot.
"The employee comes first, then the client, then the bottom line," said Jeff Peters, executive vice president.

1. Lesson No. 1: Skip those chilled beer mugs. Ales with big, rich flavors should be poured into red wine glasses. The smooth, round shape of the glass brings out strong flavors much better than the angles at the bottom of a mug.
James Davis, director of communications for the RNC, said each hotel assignment was based on cost and the size of the delegation.
It's not clear what Heimerl is referring to. But he's right in that answers are forthcoming. In October, Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner Michael Campion issued a memo outlining concerns about how the strike force handles forfeiture funds, which have averaged more than $200,000 a year for the past three years. Campion's memo said that although he had no reason to believe there had been malfeasance regarding the funds, "there may not be an adequate record system to identify the source and disposition of these funds.'' That helped trigger an expedited review of the gang strike force's policies, procedures and processes by the state's respected Office of the Legislative Auditor. That report is expected to be released in about a month. The strike force's Hawaii black-eye will boost this report's profile and should spur those involved with the strike force to heed the auditor's conclusions and take action.
“The gangs see this and know that nothing will be done.

Bosh and Wade combined for six points in that flurry, James the other five, including a 21-footer with 1:29 left to put Miami up 78-60.
Heaven forfend that the legislature's rightists should offend the Statehouse gas-and-oil lobby, especially for a governor whose approval rating is south of 50 percent. Governors come and go; Statehouse lobbies are eternal.
One of the main reasons for the growing number of preterm births is a high number of births of twins and "higher-order multiples," all of which are more likely to come into the world too soon. Triplet-and-higher births increased nearly fivefold from 1980 to 1998 before leveling off over the last decade, and experts attribute the bulk of the rise to "assisted reproduction."

Dessert is predictable: Junior's cheesecake, which tastes like the original (specifically, straight Philadelphia cream cheese). There's also a typical ice cream sundae with a cherry on top. And in a nod to Zwiener's German heritage, there is strudel, which just misses because the wrapper that barely holds together chunks of apple seasoned with cinnamon, sugar and butter is but a single sheet of floury pastry.
Hopefully, Sara says, she will someday find a career doing something similar to what she's doing now.

Pakistani officials have denied knowing he was there but have criticized the American raid ordered by President Barack Obama as a violation of their country's sovereignty. To counter allegations that Pakistan had harbored bin Laden, the officials have pointed out that many thousands of Pakistani citizens, and up to 3,000 of its security forces, have died in suicide bombings and other attacks since Sept. 11, 2001, when Islamabad became an ally of the U.S. in taking on Islamist extremists.
"We try to tell the story of the bridge in many different ways," said Robert Lieber, a vice president of the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, which worked with the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District and National Park Service to create the pavilion.

Buy a season ticket -- even a package of two $9 bleacher seats per game ($1,458 for the season) -- and you get the use of a luxury suite for one game, Club seats for one game and a membership to the once-exclusive Terrace Club. What, no use of the trainer's hot tub? The team has a bunch of other deals we'd never have thought possible in the "all-star-at-every-position" days.
"So it's not just adding a gritty guy here or there. You can have all the gritty guys you want, but when you're giving up 2-on-1s, 3-on-2s and 4-on-2s, and making poor decisions to give up these odd-man rushes, I don't care how much grit you've got in your lineup. About the only thing they're going to do is pull the puck out of the net harder. That's what our problem is, for us to win, we need to play a certain way. We're very successful playing that way. And the last 10 games, we have gotten away from that. It's not based on who's in the lineup because the same players that were in it before these guys came back, we were having the same difficulties. It's not based on personnel ... it's based on attitude."
That might coincide with the June meeting of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, where the Americans are expected to make currency a priority. It would let Beijing's envoys respond to U.S. complaints by saying it was already taking action.
According to several township residents, it’s a problem that’s been plaguing their homes and families for months.
But some critics say the system isn't nearly as prolific at saving the lives of children who are in real danger - primarily youngsters abducted by homicidal sexual predators who don't know their victims - as its supporters claim.

Governments struggling with debt -- built up during the recession and in some cases over years of living beyond their means -- have slashed spending and raised taxes. But such austerity measures threaten to undermine desperately needed economic growth, in turn making it harder for nations to repay their debts.
After visiting Nepal and hearing the Dalai Lama speak in Arizona, he founded the Milarepa Fund, which organized the first Tibetan Freedom Concert in Golden Gate Park in 1996. The event brought together artists like Smashing Pumpkins, No Doubt and Foo Fighters and raised $800,000 to support the cause of Tibetan independence.
Tuesday's half-day outing was a bit of a homecoming for Hutson. Back in the late '70s and early '80s -- long before she became one of South Florida's top chefs -- Hutson and her ex-husband operated the charter fishing boat Ace Sea out of Miami's Dinner Key Marina, and later Islamorada's Holiday Isle Resort, now renamed the Postcard Inn Beach Resort & Marina at Holiday Isle. The Ace Sea specialized in offshore fishing for sailfish, dolphin, wahoo and tuna.

"They've ... been there," Blues captain David Backes said. "They reached the pinnacle last year and proved they are the best team in the NHL. The same style of game that we play is the way they did it. There's no question we're trying to get to that level, where it's every single night, it's playoff caliber teams we're doing it against, and it's on the road we're doing it.

Mickelson is chasing his fourth green jacket. I was there when he won his first. That day belonged to Mickelson. And the ultimate big moment on Sunday might belong to Mickelson, too. But for most of America, the Woods-watch is going to continue on Sunday. I'm pleased that Woods apologized for his outburst. But it's his humanity that captured us in the first place.
Mr. Gary, the former fire chief, says he's skeptical of a "prescriptive, one-size-fits-all formula." But he would like to see consistency in what is included in response times, and transparency about those times, broken down by district. "The customer needs to know how many calls are responded to in an acceptable period of time," he says.
The other reason has to do with the status of theatrical exhibitors as the weakest link in the 3-D process. (Some theaters have already been caught reducing light levels on the screen to extend the life of expensive projector lamps.) What happened to me and others at the ArcLight the other night was the height of absurdity. Here we were watching a production that cost somewhere in the neighborhood of a quarter-billion dollars. Yet our enjoyment was compromised by button batteries that can't cost more than a buck a pop. And we were an invited audience, privileged to see an advance screening, not moviegoers paying hefty premiums for their 3-D experience. I shudder to think what they see.
Consumer tracking is the foundation of an online advertising economy that racked up $23 billion in ad spending last year. Tracking activity is exploding. Researchers at AT&T Labs and Worcester Polytechnic Institute last fall found tracking technology on 80% of 1,000 popular sites, up from 40% of those sites in 2005.

The Boy Scouts of America's policy of not allowing gays within its ranks has been debated for more than a decade since being upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. It is facing renewed questioning in eastern Ohio after Jennifer Tyrrell, the mother of a 7-year-old scout, was thrown out in April.
Some of the biggest government changes may have come in the past two years. The 2009 federal stimulus expanded a 1990s tuition tax credit especially tilted to the middle class.

(10-27) 04:00 PDT Washington -- With one week to go until the Nov. 2 election, Republican Senate candidate Carly Fiorina entered a Los Angeles hospital Tuesday with an infection related to her reconstructive surgery following breast cancer last year.
Mamet constructs a taut, one-act legal procedural, with questions of innocence and evidence tossed around as deftly the blue rubber ball that the two partners play catch with while brainstorming theories about the case. At the same time, he grafts on a running editorial, advancing a strangely reductive view of identity politics and social relations and a set of fixed notions about how people act accordingly.
Free or donation classes aren't new to the Twin Cities -- many studios have a free day or a single pay-what-you-can session weekly or monthly. For example, Yogastudio in Plymouth offers several each week, Luminous Yoga offers $5 classes on Tuesdays at 6:30 p.m. near Thomas Beach at Lake Calhoun, and Lululemon in St. Louis Park has free classes on Sundays.

“Well, it was quick for what it usually is,” Rivers said. “Usually they wait until the day of (the next game), and historically it’s been after shootaround. And you get back to the hotel and you get the information that a guy’s not playing. That was one of the complaints a lot of the guys had, and to me the fact they did it early enough for us — you know, it was after practice, but at least it gave us enough time to prepare for it.”
Promptly at 8 a.m., Target employees began letting in groups of 10 to 15 shoppers at a time. Once inside, dozens of women (and a few men) swarmed the displays and grabbed hangers of gauzy blouses and printed frocks, some snatching clothes from other people's hands. Some circled the racks like hungry lions posed to devour a fresh kill, swooping in to pluck an item up from in between the hordes.
Other obesity researchers also see value in the device. It can provide useful feedback and motivation, says James Hill, the executive director of the Anschutz Health and Wellness Center at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver. Nonetheless, he adds, "this is just a tool, and people still have to decide to make the commitment ... and to maintain that behavior."
The Northern Snakehead Control and Management Plan was requested by Congress, whose members were alarmed by the "potential impact on native fish populations."

In the modernized version, the story becomes "The Hounds of Baskerville" and focuses on a young man named Henry Knight (Russell Tovey) who, as a boy, allegedly saw his father torn to shreds in front of him by a huge hound. This time around, Baskerville is the name of a top-secret government military base with an animal research lab. Could the hound be some genetically engineered mutant from Baskerville?

"I’ve never seen a witness in all my career … who has committed all the crimes he has," said Critchley, who has been a lawyer for nearly 40 years.
“We feel the division runs through Foxborough. We have to defend them,” Pettine said. “You saw the tight ends drafted. New England, I think, has set the trend for it, and we have to respond to it. So that’s why we kind of have to find those guys who maybe 10 years ago weren’t your natural inside ‘backers because of their size. These guys are glorified strong safeties.”

Much of May's success was rooted in his tremendous marketing skill. Though he didn't draw especially well and wasn't licensed as an architect until the 1980s, he wrote much of the advertising copy for Cliff May Homes.
For manufacturers, cutting salt requires more than just laying off the shaker. Salt balances flavors and textures in products like bread, cheese, cereal and yogurt-based drinks that don't necessarily taste salty. It acts as a preservative, fighting the growth of bacteria. Perhaps the biggest hurdle of all is that, to our salt-saturated tongues, without sodium food can taste bland.
"Some of them are completely paralyzed. They cannot run. They stand totally still. This is something they never show on TV," Breivik said. "It was very strange."
The Star Tribune reported on April 5 that six Strike Force investigators traveled to Hawaii for an Asian gangs conference at a cost of $16,800.
Do I think these guys are sharp? Yes. Am I optimistic that Snead and Fisher will do a good job? Yes. But this, after all, is the Show-Me State. We'll see if Snead and Fisher can consistently make the necessary roster improvements. If they can't open a talent pipeline through the draft, then Rams Park will remain an NFL wasteland.

Or merely the wearing of skintight clothing?

2000 ... OF SHAUN BOYD (13th overall): The Cardinals viewed Boyd as a potential leadoff type, who had experience at second base but projected better at center field. He was the first high school position player taken by the Cardinals since 1991, and right from the start his progress was halting. Boyd topped out at Triple-A, when forced there.

Something like Taifat al-Tawhed Wal-Jihad, he wrote. Or Jama'at I'Adat al-Khilafat al-Rashida. Something snazzy like that.

When Korean Americans demand a single Koreatown district, even though voters there would be predominantly Latino, it represents a first step in a political coming of age (to be followed, if history is a guide, by a more deft and sophisticated forging of coalitions).

Their extra-base power. The Cards lead the league in homers, slugging percentage, and isolated power despite having lost a player (Pujols) with the fourth-best all-time career slugging percentage. They have six everyday players with slugging percentages above .500, seven if you count Matt Carpenter. To put that into context, the MV3 lineup of 2004 (which led the NL in scoring by a wide margin) only had four regulars who slugged above .500 ---- and that was in an era when overall scoring was higher than it is today. The Cards are on pace to bash 236 homers, or 22 more than the MV3 team amassed. Unless I'm mistaken, that would be the highest one-year total in franchise history.

It might not be the latest-hottest-gotta-be-there address in town. But more than a decade after opening, the Blue Point remains one of the city's best restaurants. One of the first places to establish the Warehouse District as a food-and-drink destination, this lovely, airy seafood restaurant and bar is still more than worth the drive.

Entrees include meat, poultry and pasta, but it's the seafood that's the standout, such as the seared ahi tuna -- mouth-melting tender. The almond-crusted tilapia with lobster basmati rice and garlic beurre blanc was a delight, with the mild flaky fish perfectly encrusted in the flavorful nuts and nicely paired with the richly flavored rice.

If you wait too long to tell someone you've changed your mind, you're more likely to seriously annoy several managers who have been counting on your presence and contributions. More people at the company also are aware of you after you've accepted the offer than they might have been when it was simply offered to you. Because of that, you expose yourself to greater criticism when you change your mind.
Most retirees miss out on the juicy returns for delaying benefits. The most popular age to begin collecting is 62. Many retirees simply need the money.

Wurzelbacher faces Huron auctioneer Steve Kraus, a political unknown, in the March 6 Republican primary for the 9th district.

Indeed, a no-holds-barred bid to organize more reality-show writers was a major plank of Patric Verrone's successful campaign to become president of the Writers Guild of America, West, two years ago. Verrone, perceived as a hard-liner, has since become a thorn in the studios' side during the recent negotiations. One key factor in the rancorous breakdown of talks Dec. 7 was the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers' demand that the guild drop its proposal to extend union membership to writers of reality, as well as animated, material.

In 2011 Laureate Kappa Omega had selected two such members, Linda Jonas and Georgia Berry, for that honor, so they presented the honor Wednesday night via a skit about "How to Grow A Woman of the Year" with all the appropriate props of soil, garden tools, aprons, pot, flowers and sunshine. It was no surprise to the rest of the members that Nancy Carey took the "Blue Ribbon" prize this year and was selected as Woman of the Year.

Well, my first musical influences were hearing some jazz albums my dad had bought me -- Dizzy Gillespie, Arturo Sandoval and Maynard Ferguson. When I started playing trumpet in the fourth-grade band, I was really just learning to play -- band music and simple melodies. I played in my first jazz band in the 10th grade at Firestone High School, then in the Tri-C All Star Band. I played my first classical solo in the 11th grade but never played in an orchestra until I arrived at Oberlin as a freshman in college. I'd say that I seriously got into classical music before I did jazz, but that they have both maintained a balance in my musical and listening life.

The rest of the large cast — which ranges from France’s current first lady, Carla Bruni, to Marion Cotillard as Wilson’s new flame — is fine, too. Particularly hysterical are Corey Stoll as a relentlessly macho Hemingway, and Adrien Brody as the already odd Dalí.
"This has been one of the greatest experiences I've ever had. I'm really proud of this program, what we're trying to do right now, and where it's headed.

Lundqvist is now a remarkable 22-6-5 against Brodeur, every bit the Rafael Nadal to his Roger Federer. The Devils goalie called facing Lundqvist fun because “he’s a guy they put on a pedestal for a reason,” but he’s too proud for it not to drive him crazy. The only way to get revenge?

BTR member Kendall Schmidt says its latest success proves it's more than a novelty. "We'd all be lying if we said the first thing we planned to do was sing in a boy band.

The memo is about salesmanship, not substance. It doesn't address whether the lines are accurate. It just says they are effective and that Republicans should use them. Indeed, facing a Democratic plan that actually relied on the free market to try to bring down costs, Luntz recommended sidestepping that inconvenient fact:
(3) Accepting that proximity won't make you close. This is the one you hinted around, but I'll just say it: If you talk to your parents and stand up for your wife and still your parents mistreat her, then you need to release your wife from your kumbaya expectations. Tell her that, while you hope she'll come occasionally, she's welcome to opt out of visits.
There's no pecking order on the team now. Nobody is worried about who gets the most touches. Van Gundy doesn't seem to be walking on egg shells any longer.

"I think the NBA is, in my opinion, if you look at all the major sports, it's probably the most progressive," he said. "So it doesn't surprise me at all that the NBA goes through the steps to make sure that African-Americans get recognized at whatever time they need to be. You look across the board in the NBA and there's a nice mix of diversity within the NBA right now. Obviously, at 35 as an African-American, I had an opportunity to be a head coach. You look around the league and see that in a lot of different positions, not just coaching positions. So it's good to be a part of the NBA, especially with what's going in Washington right now."
Well-endowed campaigns run by big industrial interests often succeed by the sheer volume of advertising.

But nowhere was Greer's version of "inclusion" better on display than at the past Republican National Convention.

That's one reason the "mobile restaurants," as some prefer to call them, have been "exploding" of late, said William Bender, a food service consultant in Santa Clara.

Gary Kubiak is noted as a strong QB coach (because he played the position behind Elway and because he coached Elway and Young with Shanahan and has coached Matt Schaub who was on the way to the Pro Bowl in 2011 before getting injured).

"Issues of how plainclothes officers are deployed, training, stuff like that, that's all fine and well. … This was a perfect storm, and the commissioner and the mayor for political purposes put this commission together. In a lot of ways, they're reinventing the wheel."
At nearly 6,000 feet, Timberline is nearly halfway up 11,239-foot Mt. Hood. Its chairlifts reach where the snow never melts. This is the land of endless winter.

While former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty endorsed Romney immediately after dropping out of the presidential race last summer, Bachmann did not. Her endorsement comes nearly four months to the day after she ended her campaign for the GOP nomination in January.

"All these things are creating doubt and a little fear," said Patrick Rishe, Webster University sports economist and Forbes magazine columnist. "From a pure business perspective, I'd say this is good business for him to play his cards the way he's playing his cards. I'd say 'job well done.' Someone asked me the other day if he had a moral obligation to St. Louis football fans. I said absolutely not. His moral obligation is to do what is best for the best financial return of the owners. And if I was him, I can't say I wouldn't be doing the same things he's doing."
These may seem like simple rules, but they have been developed through years of experience of dealing with the most difficult issue this region confronts -- race.

"You go to the sound mix for a TV episode and it's done on the same dubbing stage with the same equipment that major features use. You get this glorious soundtrack.

JetBlue and its rival, Southwest Airlines Co., have been eagerly courting business travelers in recent years. The two airlines have traditionally sold almost exclusively to vacationers in search of cheap tickets, but business travelers are increasingly vital to the bottom line.

Matt Calkins: In response to charges that he was a shoot-first player with no regards to team success or defense, Jamal Crawford said last Friday that "a story could come out that I work at Voodoo Doughnut and everyone would believe it."

I just hit nine really bad shots on that one hole (the par-5 No. 15), so I think it is just keeping a level head about you and not letting what happened in the past influence what you are going to do in the future. It was definitely possible that I could have gone the other way and made a couple more doubles and a couple more bogeys and had a really bad final round, but staying in the right frame of mind really helped me.

There's a limit to how many self-help platitudes a song can bear, and it's certainly exceeded at times here. But with a brisk, pulsating track and boundless anticipation in her voice, India.Arie comes close to making the truisms ring true.

Bats usually hibernate in the hundreds, but post white-nose, experts say they’re hibernating in small clusters. Valent said one theory holds the fungus can’t grow as well in the tinier clusters. Another theory is the decrease in population allows bats to move about the mine more freely simply because there’s more room and to hibernate in places where the fungus can’t grow.
David Shipper, who owns and operates 42 cemeteries across the country, said his typical mausoleum has about 500 spaces.
"Our lines have been jammed for weeks, and I apologize," Landrieu said in interview with The Advocate of Baton Rouge in December. "But no amount of jamming is going to keep me from supporting a good work for Louisiana and the nation."
Vista del Mar also seeks to bridge the ever-widening compatibility gap between preteen and parent by hosting a triannual, nighttime event called the Survivor Book Club. Hundreds of students and their parents descend on the campus for a one-hour group discussion about a book that they have all read in the weeks prior. Students are picked by their language arts teachers to lead the discussions, and parents are always grouped with their own children.
What's happening today: This Just In plans on heading to Petco Park this afternoon and having a chat with Brewers slugger Ryan Braun. Last night Braun became the first player to hit three home runs in one game at Petco.
He lives above the canyon now but still feels a link to its floor, as many Navajo do. They are survivors -- of Washington's bloody quest for a treaty, the Long Walk, the challenges of reservation life. They are the children of Changing Woman, linked to this landscape in ways incomprehensible to the world around them.
Gov. Jerry Brown and legislative Democrats are pursuing a firefighting fee on rural homeowners significantly higher than the $90 charge passed last week by California's fire board.
Ducks after Cal and heading for the BCS title... I'm a concerned at the sight of LaMichael James, hobbling off the field, ending up on crutches and in a protective boot after the win over Cal. He's not just an important piece of this team --- he's THE most important. Winning the final two games of the season is a primary goal, but right after that comes limiting the punishment that James takes down the stretch. They'll need him healthy and in the lineup to win the whole thing. Without him, the Ducks can't beat Auburn, TCU or Boise State.
Baseball can be like that because each game is pliable enough to fit into any curve a season takes. No team goes 162-0. Great teams can still lose more than 60 games in a season.
How common are vasectomies?
"Anytime you get an honor or a record, it's nice to have," said Brown, who trails Phil Jackson, Rick Adelman and Stan Van Gundy. "I've been fortunate. I've been blessed. I've been extremely lucky to be part of a great organization and a very good basketball team that has a great player. I just feel like I'm part of a whole that will win a championship someday soon. Anytime you attain anything or achieve anything in team sports, it's a team reward and you feel good about it. But there's only one goal that I have and am looking forward to."
But forget coal. What about oil? The president killed the Keystone XL pipeline. After the BP oil spill, his administration overruled its own panel of experts to implement a moratorium on offshore drilling (while suggesting it was the experts' idea). Mr. Obama wants to revoke "subsidies" for oil companies, which are in fact the same tax write-offs that any business gets. He takes credit for the increase in oil drilling on U.S. soil but leaves out that drilling on federal and American Indian lands has gone down under his administration. He also forgets to mention that he opposes drilling off the mid-Atlantic coast, the Florida coast, the full Gulf of Mexico, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or in the Rockies.

But the Ohio Democratic Party says that a month after taking office on Jan. 10, 2011, the new treasurer used his leftover state campaign funds to start flying to New York, Washington and Park City, Utah. Mandel was apparently lining up donations for his then-impending Senate race, the Democrats say.

Mercifully, that was the extent of the frivolousness that’s marred too many of the earlier debates. Once past that, we got an articulate, informed and serious group of candidates responding to sober, intelligent questions — most of which were posed from the audience by associates of two conservative think tanks, Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute.

He looked up at the soaked stranger and handed me a yellow poncho, warning that without bright clothing I might become someone's hood ornament.
A: That's probably what Carmelo wants. Actually, I think it becomes closer to what the Heat faced when the Knicks visited AmericanAirlines Arena on Jan. 27 and launched 43 3-pointers, making 18. I think they will try to space the floor for Anthony to attack, reducing the Heat's ability to bring help, and when the Heat do double-team, lock and launch from the perimeter. Steve Novak and J.R. Smith may have wrist issues when Game 3 is over. Of course, Mike Woodson has been doing everything possible to distance himself from the Mike D'Antoni approach, so perhaps not.
Mark Minden, a neighborhood improvement specialist with the city, was not convinced. "It's beyond frustrating," he complained.
And the moment seems to fit the time -- a time when diners are looking less for a bill to brag about than a place to belong. In Portland's most successful episode of "Upstairs, Downstairs," Eric and Connie Laslow have built a place to belong.

Government critics, and even some supporters, are ridiculing a state TV host's allegation that a newspaper crossword puzzle may have had a hidden call for a plot to kill President Hugo Chavez's elder brother.
Employment specialists know about this trend. The leader in a Maryland state workshop for the recently unemployed suggested that experienced workers list only the last 10 years of their work history on resumes. Otherwise, they might appear overqualified or embarrass HR or management staff "who had not been born when you started work."
Tim Maki, co-chairman of the Anthem branch, believes that people are still giving but there is greater demand for help from the utility pot as a result of the Great Recession.

Anything to break the monotony of each spin through a football player’s life cycle, which for him lasts anywhere between a day and a month.
First, the court could allow the state’s cuts, handing a victory to Christie. Second, the court could grant the state a "time out," meaning a temporary reprieve from fully funding schools during the economic crisis. The third option would force the state to fully fund the formula. The court may even require it to pay schools the $820 million already cut, which would be devastating to Christie, who has tried to pare state spending and avoid tax increases.

After telling my friend about the pinot noir, I decided to try it myself, so I went to the Brentwood Pointe store and picked up a bottle for $13.98.
But he was absolutely right. It's talent. Either you got it or you ain't. Give someone else the premise of "Blazing Saddles" and you'd probably get only the vulgarity. Only the farting scene. Give it to me and my cohorts and the engine is the prejudice against the black sheriff that drives the movie. So you've got to know how to do it.
"What crap? What crap?" Joudeh replied angrily.
Regime change in Bahrain could enable Russia to recoup at least part of its losses in the region. Yugoslavia’s breakup and regime change in Libya deprived Russia of all but one of its “naval facilities” in the Mediterranean: the Syrian port of Tartus. (The fall of Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, deprived Russia of facilities in the Iraqi port of Um-Qasar, shutting it out of the Persian Gulf.)
But by the late 1990s the California Youth Authority had become a network of grim and violent youth prisons that were so abusive and so destructive to their mission that all but a few were shut down. A majority of the 10,000 state wards returned to probation departments in their home counties; just over 1,000 remain in what is now the state prison system's Division of Juvenile Justice.
San Francisco issued an ordinance to ban distribution of the phone books, except to customers who are home to physically accept them or give prior approval by phone, mail or sticky note left on the door.

O'Donnell said he expects some $250-$300 tablets to hit the market later this year. One producer that several analysts are watching is Amazon.com.

Cook the pancakes: Use nonstick cooking-oil spray to grease a nonstick skillet, then place it over medium-high heat. For each pancake, pour in about 1/4 cup of batter, spacing the pancakes at least 1 inch apart. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the tops are marked with bubbles and the edges appear cooked. Carefully turn the pancakes over; cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until the bottoms are lightly browned.
Personal story: "After being the runner up in the IHSA State Track Meet in May 2011, I had made plans to train all summer and fall in order to become a better thrower in the 2012 track and field season and hopefully win a state championship. During the summer of 2011, I suffered an ACL tear during a basketball game. This injury immediatley ceased any plans that I had of training during the summer and also kept me from participating in the other sports that I had always played prior to the injury. After my surgery, I slowly began trying to lift weights and practiced my throwing by sitting in a chair so I wasn't using my legs. Six months later, in January 2012, I was able to participate in track and really begin training for my goals. I currently am still working and competing and have been able to stay pretty consistent with where I left off last season. This injury has been difficult to deal with and a long one to recover from. I do think that it has made me a stronger person and will continue to daily work in order to hopefully achieve my goals. I think that when an individual deals with an obstacle in his/her life, it can truly make that person stronger."

Gingrich has disputed Romney’s characterization of his firm’s work for Freddie Mac, arguing that he was hired because of his expertise as a historian. During a November debate, he said he "offered them advice on precisely what they didn't do" and that he warned the mortgage giant, "This is a bubble. This is insane." Bloomberg published a story disputing Gingrich's account after interviewing people familiar with Gingrich's work who said they did not recall Gingrich warning about the company's business model.

The televised debate is traditionally a high point in France's presidential election campaign, offering voters the only chance to see the candidates up close and trading barbs around a table. In 2007, over 20 million people, or about half of registered voters, watched the debate between Mr. Sarkozy and Ségolène Royal, Mr. Hollande's former partner and then the Socialist candidate, which went on far beyond the two hours allotted in the TV schedule.

The Gladiators were unsuccessful Friday night in their bid for their first four-game winning streak in franchise history, as the Tampa Bay Storm came away with a 69-48 victory at Tampa Bay Times Forum.

"You want to do this so that the people who live in these areas don’t get hit," said Filippone, who helped establish the coalition 41 years ago.
As The Oregonian has reported, planners have spent more than a million dollars a month for several years on project studies, mostly ignoring calls from members of Congress from the Northwest to dramatically scale back the project's scope and construction cost. Though planners have spent $65 million, and expect to have spent $100 million by this summer, local political consensus on the project remains elusive.

"The reference to national consensus is a reference to the need for there to be a climate and atmosphere of unity and responsibility," Venizelos said, according to a statement released by his office.
Here's what I like already. There seem to be just as many "buts" in the CVC's current offers as "yesses." In the original deal, the city, county and state negotiators just said "yes" to everything that Rams president John Shaw asked for. St. Louis negotiated from a stance of desperation the first time, which is how Shaw was able to stick in so many incredible clauses in this lease in the first place. As one person close to those original negotiations told me a few years ago, "We kept waiting for someone to say, 'OK, we'll agree to that, BUT you have to give us this … ' And the 'but' never came."
Records obtained Thursday by The Arizona Republic in response to a public-records request show that, on March 9, Pinal County Manager Fritz Behring asked the state Attorney General's Office and LaWall for help in investigating what he said was the potential destruction of public records. The following week, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel expanded its ongoing Hatch Act politicking inquiry.
But while it isn't often so many eyes are on UH, the Cougars aren't the type of team to be easily distracted by the attention or bothered by the noise. For them, the goal they brought into the season, the objective that pushed them through torturous workouts in last summer's oppressive heat hasn't changed.

Though I'm a deep-fried turkey fan and couldn't find a recipe, I wasn't eager to risk disfigurement from lowering an enormous bird into a vat of boiling oil - if I could even find a big enough vat - so I nixed that idea.

At issue is the publishers' decision to stop selling ebooks wholesale to the likes of Amazon and Barnes & Noble and to shift to the "agency" approach proposed by Apple. Under the original system, publishers sold ebooks to retailers at about half the cover price and let the retailers determine what to charge consumers for them. Amazon had been selling popular new e-books at a loss — and, to the publishers' chagrin, at a far lower price than hardback editions — to promote sales of its Kindle reader. The agency model, by contrast, requires retailers to charge the price set by the publisher, while allowing them to keep 30% of the sales revenue.

Coaches return my calls, I'm privy to inside information, not because of the way I look but because of how I do my job.

Massie devotes fully half his text to a vivid narrative of the difficult years prior to Elizabeth's death in late 1761. We see Catherine developing the formidable skills she would ably deploy as empress. She adroitly handled her puerile husband and his imperious aunt with a guileful blend of charm, submissiveness and carefully chosen moments of defiance. She cultivated supporters in the Russian aristocracy alienated by Peter's worship of all things German. Catherine, by contrast, adopted the Orthodox faith and quickly learned to speak fluent Russian. When Peter, upon acceding to the throne, secularized all Russian church property and switched sides to support Prussia in the Seven Years' War, the stage was set for the bloodless coup that made Catherine empress in June 1762: Peter, strangled by her supporters probably without Catherine's knowledge, was the only casualty.

Don Banks, SI.com: "Boy do the Rams now occupy the catbird seat going into Friday night's second round. St. Louis owns the No. 33 selection, the first pick of the round, which is always coveted by teams that didn't get the player it wanted in the first round and are entertaining a trade back up to land that spot. In addition, St. Louis has the No. 39, a pick acquired in the Redskins trade, and No. 45, which the Cowboys sent them for the right to move up eight spots to sixth. So far, this rebuilding program in St. Louis is unfolding at warp speed in the Jeff Fisher coaching era. The second round could be a bonanza for the Rams, perhaps setting them up with at least three new starters."

øNike + GPS: (Apple, $1.99). Let you map your runs, chart progress. "I hate running … I mean HATE it. But I am a competitive person. Nike+ GPS plots out my runs and actually shows me on a map when I picked up speed (or in my case shows the steady decline in speed) as well as (giving) me constant updates on how far I have gone.
